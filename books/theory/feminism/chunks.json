My family fostered \nmy lifelong love affair with school, as did a number of excellent teachers, \nnotably Ken Edwards, now retired from W. Reily Brown Elementary \nSchool, and Linda Gehling, now retired from Caesar Rodney High School. \nYears later, as a graduate student at Temple University, where I began \ndeveloping some of the ideas presented in this book, I was encouraged \nby Miriam Solomon and Chuck Dyke of Temple University, as well as \nSandra Harding, who was then teaching for part of each year at the \nUniversity of Delaware. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was forever \nchanged when Sandra Harding first introduced me to queer theory.\nI am extremely grateful for ongoing encouragement and support \nfrom the staff and faculty of the EWU Women’s and Gender Studies \nprogramme, including Christi Wavada, Carol Vines, Kelly Coogan and, \nespecially, Sally Winkle and Elizabeth Kissling, who have provided much-\nneeded mentoring throughout my career at EWU. I am also grateful \nfor the members of the EWU philosophy programme, particularly \nTerry MacMullan, Kevin Decker, and Chris Kirby. These colleagues \nare some of my favourite people, and I am better for knowing them. \nI have also benefited from the ongoing exchange of ideas with faculty \nacross disciplinary boundaries. I would like to thank Jenny Thomson for \norganizing monthly gatherings of women faculty and staff to share Thai \nfood and discuss our ongoing projects and research, including portions of \nthis book. I would also like to thank the members of the EWU College of \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences ‘Theory Committee’ for many discussions \nabout the philosophy of the social sciences.

Indeed, while much of the work for this project \nwas done during a 2007–2008 sabbatical from teaching, generously \nfunded by Eastern Washington University, most of it was done in direct \nconnection with my teaching. I have benefited from discussions with \nstudents in many of my classes, most notably ‘GLBT Studies’ and, more \nrecently, ‘Queer Theory’, which I offered for the first time in the spring \nquarter of 2010. The students in this course graciously read the chapters \nof this manuscript, occasionally as unedited first drafts, providing \nformative feedback and welcome encouragement along the way. Over \nthe past several years, many students, including some I now count \namong my friends and colleagues, have contributed substantially to my \nunderstanding of gender, sex, and sexuality. One such example is Kenny \nCapps, who served as a teaching assistant for my ‘GLBT Studies’ course \nin the fall quarter of 2006. Others include Megan Cuilla, Sali McNamee \n(now Sayler), and Kimberly Stankovich, with whom I collaborated on a \n‘Constructed Identities’ panel for the Queer ID Conference at Boise State \nUniversity in October 2006. I am also grateful for conversations, some \nmore recent than others, with Michael Barrett, Willow Moline, Krista \nBenson, and countless others.\nBefore I even knew what it meant, my friend Jeff Thorpe accused me \nof being a philosopher. Almost thirty years later, I now understand how \nremarkable it was, first, that someone knew me well enough to accurately \nproject the trajectory of my adult life and, second, that I had a friend who \nliked me because of, rather than in spite of, my penchant for analysis and \ndeconstruction. I am fortunate to have the support of a few other equally \nremarkable friends, including Jeff Wootten, Kim Rosenthal Budner, and \nPolly Buckingham. Polly Buckingham also deserves special thanks for \nteaching me that the surest way to get my work published is to submit \nmy work for publication.\nMy personal life became complicated during the final stages of \npreparing this manuscript, and I will always be grateful to Heather Elder, \nCameron Smith Norton, Cindy Wells, Tom Tam, and Jim Jenkins for \nreaching out to me with friendship in exactly the right ways at exactly \nthe right times. I am also grateful to Carol Bjork and the other instructors \nand dancers at the Jazzercise Fitness Center of Spokane for helping me to \nmaintain my physical and mental health through challenging times.\nFinally, I would like to thank the editorial staff at Zed Books, \nparticularly Tamsine O’Riordan, as well as the art team that designed the \ncover image, and an anonymous reader who provided useful suggestions \nfor fine-tuning the final draft of this manuscript. \n",

Frank Baum, The Magic of Oz, p.568)\nOnce considered quite offensive, ‘queer’ is now used with increasing \nregularity, often as a straightforward alternative to ‘gay’. Consider, for \nexample, its use in the title of the recent HBO hit Queer as Folk, which \nfeatured a group of friends comprised mostly of gay-identified men, or \nBravo’s Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (later just Queer Eye), which \nfeatured fashion and lifestyle advice from, again, a group of gay-identified \nmen. While I am neither naive enough nor arrogant enough to suppose \nthat ‘queer’ admits of just one interpretation, namely the one I happen \nto provide, I do recognize that the casual trend of replacing ‘gay’ with \n‘queer’ ignores some important theoretical work aimed at exposing the \nrepresentational limitations of ‘gay’ and the comparable representational \nrichness of ‘queer’. I also recognize that the oversimplification of \ncomplicated concepts in the popular media is a sure sign that the larger \nculture is at least vaguely aware of those concepts. This book aims to \nprovide background and context for those who are curious about the \nrecent insertion of ‘queer’ into polite vernacular. This book also aims \nto provide background and context for those who encounter ‘queer’ in \nscholarly writing that is often so mired in technical jargon that it may \nseem utterly meaningless to the uninitiated. \nIntroductory texts in gender studies, sometimes identified as women’s \nstudies or feminist studies, address gender identity.

This book is, in part, an \nattempt to fill that gap, and could therefore serve as a text for any course \nof study, be it in a university setting or in the context of independent \nscholarship, directed towards the examination of virtually any aspect of \ngender, sex, and sexuality.\nThe structure of this book makes it useful for readers at different \nlevels and from different fields. While the chapters and sections of this \nbook fit together as interconnected components of a coherent whole, \nthey can also be read separately. Those who choose to read chapters or \nsections out of context or out of order should refer to the appendix as \nneeded. Potentially unfamiliar terminology is carefully explained, often in \nfootnotes, as it occurs throughout the text, and these explanations are in \nturn collected in the appendix, which is aptly titled ‘Terms and Concepts’. \nThis manner of presentation allows readers who do not require additional \nbackground information to read the main text with minimal interruption, \nwhile simultaneously offering helpful explication for those who need \nit. This is especially useful given that one of the greatest challenges in \nteaching queer theory, which is inherently interdisciplinary, is the varying \ndegree of student familiarity with relevant background concepts. This \noften leads students to seek definitions, either from a dictionary or from \nthe instructor. Unfortunately, dictionary definitions, which are detached \nfrom the specific context in which the terms occur, often do very little \nto promote understanding of specialized academic terminology. Indeed, \nqueer theory resists the reductionist practice of pretending that it \nis possible to delineate, once and for all, the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for membership in any given category. Nevertheless, it is often \nnecessary to provide an entering wedge for the uninitiated. Presenting \ncontextualized explanations in the form of commentary and discussion \nprovides this entering wedge without thereby pretending to offer a fixed \nor final account of that which is always and inevitably in a state of flux.\nThe book is divided into three main sections and a shorter fourth \nsection. The first section, ‘Sexuality’, consists of three chapters, including \nChapter 1, ‘The Social Construction of Sexuality’; Chapter 2, ‘The Social \nHistory of Lesbian and Gay Identity’; and Chapter 3, ‘Queer Alternatives’. \nChapter 1 summarizes the emergence of the various concepts of sexuality \nand sexual identity that exist in contemporary western culture, and \ncompares them with concepts employed throughout history and across \ncultures. Chapter 2 traces the relatively recent emergence, first of gay \nidentity, and then of lesbian identity. Chapter 3 then introduces queer \nidentity as an alternative to more familiar categories of sexual identity, \nwhich usually concentrate on sexual partner choice and ignore the many \nother subtleties surrounding sexual pleasure and desire.

While Chapter 4 examines the \nrole of medical technology in enforcing a boundary between female and \nmale bodies, particularly in the case of intersex bodies, Chapter 5 explores \nthe implications of this boundary enforcement for transgender people. \nThe third section, ‘Gender’, consists of Chapter 6, ‘Gender Defined and \nUndefined’, and Chapter 7, ‘Feminism Examined and Explored’. Chapter \n6 examines the concept of gender, especially its role in linguistic contexts. \nChapter 7 summarizes the various attitudes concerning gender and gender \noppression collected under the banner of feminism. The fourth and final \nsection, ‘Queer Feminism’, contains just one chapter, namely Chapter 8, \ntitled ‘Notes Toward a Queer Feminism’, which explores what a queer \napproach to feminism might involve. I should note that although it is \nuseful as a rough and ready way of organizing a potentially overwhelming \nbody of material, the division of this material into sections on sexuality, \nsex, and gender is rather imprecise given the intimate interconnections \nbetween and among these concepts.\nFor those seeking only a brief introduction to queer theory, feminism, \nor the connections between them, this book, or even individual sections \nor chapters of this book, may be sufficient. For those seeking a more \ndetailed explanation of these ideas and issues, each chapter provides a list \nof additional resources, including scholarly books and articles, as well \nas audio-visual material and works of fiction. Instead of recommending \nobscure material that the average reader would be unable to access, \nI have made an effort, whenever possible, to recommend material \nthat is fairly easy to come by, for example in online sources or widely \nreprinted in various anthologies. I have included videos and novels \nfor the dual purpose of providing relevant information and examples, \nwhile simultaneously implementing my understanding that people are \nsometimes better able to learn new material when it is presented in a \nvariety of different formats.\nI did not cover all of the material that I could have, and my decisions \nabout what to include and what to exclude are largely the product of \nmy own introduction to this literature. ‘It is a delusion’, notes Sandra \nHarding, ‘to think that human thought could completely erase the \nfingerprints that reveal its production process’ (Harding, 1993, p.57). \nThis is the case with the representation of any subject matter, and \ntherefore it is likewise the case, not only with queer theory and feminist \ntheory in general, but also with my own representation of queer theory \nand feminist theory in particular. Although queer theory and feminist \ntheory are both informed by lived experience and grass-roots activism, \nmuch of their development has taken place inside the ivory towers of \nacademia. Insofar as queer theory and feminist theory constitute academic \nprojects, they are inevitably covered with the fingerprints of race and \nclass privilege. My presentation of this subject matter is no exception, \n",

As discussed \nin Chapter 8, much of the appeal of queer theory and at least some \nforms of feminist theory is that, while ostensibly about gender, sex, \nand sexuality, they likewise comprise a critique of what Karen Warren \n(2000) refers to as the ‘logic of domination’, which attempts to justify \nthe systematic subordination of those who lack power by those who \npossess it. Queer theory and feminist theory thus invite a critical analysis \nof racism, capitalism, globalization, and other expressions of the logic of \ndomination. To the extent that a critical analysis of racism, capitalism, \nglobalization, or anything else, can contribute to an understanding of \nthe logic of domination, it thereby contributes to both queer theory and \nfeminist theory.\nSubtle but powerful expressions of the logic of domination are \nprevalent in the ordinary use of the English language, but I have taken care \nthroughout this text to avoid unnecessarily oppressive turns of phrase. I \nresist what is sometimes referred to as ableist language, for example, by \navoiding visual and auditory metaphors such as ‘seeing’ the point and \n‘listening’ to reason. Instead, I reserve visual and auditory references for \nthose fairly rare contexts in which vision or hearing is actually relevant \nto the ideas that I aim to express. This is analogous to avoiding allegedly \ngeneric uses of ‘man’ and ‘men’, as discussed in Chapter 6, and instead \nreserving those terms for contexts in which sex and gender are of some \nrelevance. I also avoid the use of unnecessary bodily metaphors, such as \n‘standing up’ for a cause. In addition, I resist the use of binary language \nby avoiding the gender pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘him’, ‘his’, and ‘her’, and I \nresist the use of universalizing language by avoiding the plural pronouns \n‘we’ and ‘our’. I also resist oppositional language by avoiding such \nexpressions as ‘arguably’, and ‘on the contrary’.\nThroughout this book, I have attempted to avoid what Janice Moulton \n(1996) refers to as the adversary paradigm. \nUnder the Adversary Paradigm, it is assumed that the only, or \nat any rate, the best, way of evaluating work in philosophy is to \nsubject it to the strongest or most extreme opposition. And it is \nassumed that the best way of presenting work in philosophy is to \naddress it to an imagined opponent and muster all the evidence one \ncan to support it. \n (Moulton, 1996, p.14)\n",

Insofar as this manner of presentation disrupts the \npresumably stable meaning of what philosophical reasoning entails, it \ncan be understood as an example of queering. This will be discussed in \nmore detail later, but for now I will borrow from Krista Benson (2010) the \ndelightfully simple explanation that queer theory is the recognition that \n‘shit’s complicated’. Queering thus refers to the process of complicating \nsomething, and it is not necessarily limited to sexual contexts. Indeed, it \nis queer to do philosophy without making arguments. It is likewise queer \nto live in ways that challenge deeply held assumptions about gender, sex, \nand sexuality. Thus, queer encompasses even those who do not identify \nas homosexual (or even as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender), but \nfind that we are nevertheless incapable of occupying the compact spaces \nto which our cultural prescriptions regarding gender, sex, and sexuality \nhave assigned us. \nMy interest in queering the philosophical process notwithstanding, \nI also aim to produce work that is both academically rigorous and \nphilosophically significant. Toward this end, I have provided information \nthat I take to be relevant in establishing context and background that \nwill, hopefully, help readers understand how I arrived at a position I \ncharacterize in Chapter 8 as queer feminism. Because queer feminism \nsupports the simultaneous viability of multiple forms of feminism, \nhowever, I have found it unnecessary to defend this form of feminism \nagainst other forms of feminism. While I could have geared my discussion \ntoward an imaginary opponent who does not accept the legitimacy of \nany form of feminism, I opted instead to address my comments to the \npeople I believe to be my likeliest readers: namely, those with an existing \ninterest in theories of gender, sex, and sexuality. \nReferences\nBaum, L.

Frank Baum, The Emerald City of Oz, p.219)\nThe Kinsey Report\nMany people who support the interests of lesbian women and gay men \nmaintain that homosexuality is a universal phenomenon. Drawing \non research conducted by Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey Institute, \nhomosexuality is often estimated to occur in roughly 10 per cent of the \npopulation. Based on thousands of detailed interviews, Kinsey’s findings \nwere published in two volumes: Sexual Behavior in the Human Male \n(Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin, 1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human \nFemale (Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, and Gebhard, 1953). These are often \nreferred to informally as the ‘Kinsey Reports’. The Kinsey Reports \nchallenged conservative beliefs about sexuality by suggesting that taboo \npractices, such as masturbation, promiscuity, and homosexuality, were \nmuch more prevalent than previously acknowledged.\nFor better or worse, the oft-quoted statistic that homosexuality occurs \nat a steady rate of 10 per cent is not a straightforward conclusion of the \nKinsey Reports. Kinsey actually reported that ‘37% of males and 13% of \nfemales had at least some overt homosexual experience to orgasm’ and \nthat ‘10% of males were more or less exclusively homosexual and 8% \nof males were exclusively homosexual for at least three years between \nthe ages of 16 and 55’. Kinsey also reported ‘a range of 2–6% for more \nor less exclusively homosexual experience/response’ among women. \nFinally, it was reported that ‘4% of males and 1–3% of females had been \nexclusively homosexual after the onset of adolescence up to the time of \nthe interview’ (as cited by The Kinsey Institute, n.d.).

    "chunk_full": " \n5\nThe Social Construction of Sexuality\nKinsey encouraged social awareness and acceptance of sexual \ndiversity, but not by attempting to establish the universal existence of a \ndiscretely homosexual population distinct from the larger heterosexual \npopulation. Rather, by characterizing sexual orientation as a continuum, \nKinsey challenged the widespread belief that, for most people, sexual \ndesire is directed exclusively toward members of just one sex category. \nMoreover, by concentrating on homosexual behaviour instead of \nhomosexual identity, Kinsey implicitly challenged what is sometimes \nreferred to as essentialism. Essentialism is the belief that homosexuality \nand other identity categories reflect innate characteristics that comprise \nthe fundamental nature of the members of those categories.2 Because the \nessentialist account regards homosexuality as an enduring feature of the \nhuman condition, rather than the product of social contingencies, those \nwho accept essentialism often assume that homosexuality is historically \nand culturally universal.\nSocial Construction\nSome theorists who resist the popular assumption that the interests of \nlesbian women and gay men are best served by an essentialist perspective \non homosexuality instead suggest that the categories associated with \nsexual pleasure and desire are historical and cultural developments. \nThis thesis, often referred to as social constructionism,3 applies to \nheterosexual identity as well as alternative sexual identity categories, \nsuch as homosexual, lesbian, gay, and bisexual. This does not mean \nthat specific sexual acts are unique to the social contexts in which they \noccur. A wide range of physical interactions and bodily manipulations \nconnected with sexual desire or conducive to sexual pleasure occur across \ncultural and historical boundaries. The relationship of these interactions \nand manipulations to socially entrenched concepts of sexuality and \ncategories of sexual identity, however, is far from universal. As Jeffrey \nWeeks notes, ‘the forces that shape and mould the erotic possibilities of \nthe body vary from society to society’ (Weeks, 2003).\nThis was the point of a landmark article, aptly titled ‘The Homosexual \nRole’ (1968), in which Mary McIntosh suggested that homosexuality is \nnot a condition by which people are affected, but rather a social role \nto which people are assigned. According to McIntosh, ‘the purpose \nof introducing the term “role” is to enable us to handle the fact that \nbehavior in this sphere does not match popular beliefs: that sexual \nbehavior patterns cannot be dichotomized in the way that the social roles \nof homosexual and heterosexual can’ (1968, p.184). McIntosh addressed \nthe influence of social role, specifically the role of homosexual male, on \nperceptions of both self and other: \n",

In addition, there are \nother expectations that frequently exist, especially on the part of \nnonhomosexuals, but affecting the self-conception of anyone who \nsees himself as homosexual. These are: the expectation that he will \nbe effeminate in manner, personality, or preferred sexual activity; \nthe expectation that sexuality will play a part of some kind in all \nhis relations with other men; and the expectation that he will be \nattracted to boys and very young men and probably willing to \nseduce them. \n(1968, pp.184–5) \nCategories of identity determine and are determined by the ways \nin which people understand themselves and are understood by others. \nIn other words, concepts of identity determine and are determined by \nthe prescriptions and proscriptions that structure and are structured by \nsocial existence. Additionally, categories of identity are often binary, \nestablished by means of a contrast between the dominant group and those \nexcluded from the dominant group.4 Indeed, the term category ultimately \nderives from the ancient Greek word kategoria, meaning ‘accusation’ \n(Iannone, 2001, p.93).5 In terms of sexual orientation, the dominant \ngroup is established by the distinction between normal and abnormal \nsexuality, coupled with the accusation that specific forms of sexuality are \ndeviant. I am homosexual only in a culture that, first, has a definition \nof homosexuality and, second, has a definition of homosexuality that \napplies to me. Likewise, I am heterosexual only in a culture that, \nfirst, has a definition of homosexuality and, second, has a definition \nof homosexuality that applies to people other than me. The concept \nof heterosexuality, and hence heterosexual identity, could not exist \nwithout the concept of homosexuality, and hence homosexual identity. \nThis inverts the customary way of thinking, in which heterosexuality is \nregarded as the primary, or original, form of sexuality and homosexuality \nis regarded as secondary, a mere variation on that first theme. For this \nreason, it has been suggested that, at least conceptually, homosexuality \nprecedes heterosexuality (Katz, 1996). At the very least, homosexual \nand heterosexual identities emerge simultaneously and, more to the \npoint, only in the context of a distinction between homosexuality and \nheterosexuality.6 \nThe existence of both homosexuality and heterosexuality is contingent \nrather than necessary. To describe something as contingent is to claim \nthat, under different circumstances, things could have turned out \ndifferently. This should not be confused with voluntarism regarding \nsexual identity. It is, as explained by Edward Stein, ‘a mistake to collapse \n",

Social constructionism does not suggest that people are free to \nchoose between homosexuality and heterosexuality. It does, however, \nsuggest that the conceptual framework, or paradigm, within which \nhomosexuality and heterosexuality occur is a historical development. To \nfully understand social constructionism, it is important to understand \nhow paradigms function. For this reason, some background information \nabout the concept of a paradigm may be useful.\nSemantic Holism\nThe notion of a paradigm, as it is used here, is an extension of a concept \nintroduced and developed in 1962 by Thomas Kuhn (1970) in reference \nto scientific practice. Kuhn maintained that the terminology employed \nwithin the various sciences is part of an interwoven web of beliefs, such \nthat the meaning of any individual term is fully understood only by \ndirect or indirect reference to the larger vocabulary and corresponding \nbelief system. The indoctrination of scientists is largely a matter of \nlanguage acquisition, and the language acquired determines standards \nof evidence and, hence, the range of empirical facts to be acknowledged \nand explained. This characterization is sometimes referred to as semantic \nholism and contrasted with semantic atomism. Whereas holism explains \nthe individual parts by reference to the greater whole, atomism explains \nthe whole by reference to its constituent parts. \nThis distinction is readily illustrated by ambiguous images conducive \nto two distinct and mutually exclusive visual interpretations. A familiar \nexample is the black and white image alternately recognized as a vase \nagainst a dark background or a silhouette of two human faces (Figure \n1.2).7 Conceived as a vase, the image cannot be described by reference \nto terms such as forehead, nose, and chin; conceived as a pair of faces, \nthe image cannot be described by reference to terms such as base, stem, \nand rim. The inference, for example, that the proximity of the lips is \nsuggestive of a kiss makes sense only if the overall image is understood \nto represent a pair of faces. Indeed, the meaning of the term lip is quite \ndifferent when applied to faces than when applied to vases. Kuhn \nmaintained that the meaning of scientific terms is likewise dependent on \nthe overall framework, or paradigm, in which those terms occur. Kuhn \nalso maintained that, just as the ambiguous image is consistent with more \nthan one interpretive framework, it is often the case that the empirical \nevidence is consistent with more than one paradigm.\nThis is not to be confused with wholesale relativism, which admits \nof no relationship between reality and interpretation, and no distinction \nbetween fact and fiction.8 The claim that the ambiguous image can be \n",

Viewers for whom the ambiguous image \nappears as two faces, if unable to switch paradigms, are overwhelmed \nby incontrovertible evidence that their interpretation is uniquely capable \nof accommodating the fact that the image consists of noses, lips, and \nvarious other facial features. Similarly, those 16th-century astronomers \nwho were unable to make the switch from the geocentric paradigm to \nthe heliocentric paradigm continued to define planetary movement as a \nchange in position relative to earth and therefore dismissed the claim that \nthe earth moved around the sun as utterly absurd.\nFigure 1.2 Ambiguous vase-face image\nCultural Variation\nAlthough Kuhn introduced the notion of a paradigm within the \nspecialized context of science, it can also be applied more broadly. \nThroughout history and across cultures, bodies have been known to \nmingle in various ways, but often without the requisite paradigm for \n",

Consider, for example, the well-documented incidence \nof anal penetration between men in ancient Athens (Dover, 1978; \nHubbard, 2003; Percy, 1996), which is often touted as evidence that \nhomosexuality has existed throughout history (Dover, 1978; Hubbard, \n2003). According to David Halperin, sex in ancient Athens ‘served \nto position social actors in the places assigned to them, by virtue of \ntheir political standing, in the hierarchical structure of the Athenian \npolity’ (Halperin, 1989 p.260). Adult male citizens occupied a higher \nsocial position than younger men, women, and slaves. Because ‘sexual \npenetration was thematized as domination’ (Halperin, 1989, p.260), \nit was consistent with the social role of the adult male citizen to seek \nsexual gratification not merely from women, but also from younger \nmen and from slaves of any age or sex. Sexual relations between older \nand younger men is often referred to as pederasty.10 As long as the \ndominant male took the dominant role, pederasty served to reinforce \nrather than threaten the social hierarchy. Within this hierarchy, however, \nthe prospect of homosexuality, conceived as sexual partnership between \nsocial equals, would have seemed absurd. Where sex is defined as an act \nof domination through penetration, the notion of equal sexual partners \nis a contradiction in terms.\nAlthough ancient Greek social structure sanctioned some acts of \nsexual penetration between men, it did not thereby condone, or even \ncomprehend, anything quite like contemporary homosexuality. Similarly, \nthe existence of various practices in non-western and Native American \ncultures is often touted as evidence that homosexuality exists across \ncultures (Nanda, 1990; Roscoe, 1991; Whitehead, 1981; Williams, \n1986). As Harriet Whitehead notes: \nThe homosexuality that other societies prescribe or condone is \nimmediately taken to be something very much like one of the forms \nof homosexuality familiar to the modern West, and the explanation \nof the foreign culture’s institutionalizing response, when offered, \nproceeds in accordance with the chosen meaning of the behavior \nin our own culture. \n(p.80)\n \nThe people identified in India as hijras provide one such example. \nThe term hijra is applied to those born male or intersex11 who \nundergo surgical castration in order to dress as women and inhabit \nan intermediate gender role. The people sometimes identified within \nNative American culture as berdaches provide another such example. \nApplied by anthropologists in reference to people who crossed gender \nlines in various Native American tribes, the term ‘berdache’ is regarded \nby some Native Americans as a careless, and sometimes offensive, \n",

Similar people existed in many \ntribes and were believed to be two-spirited, simultaneously female and \nmale. They often served as healers and performed sacred rituals. Though \nrelevant to an analysis of social roles across cultures, such examples do \nnot establish that homosexuality existed in Native America just as it \nexists in mainstream US culture today. After all, crossing gender lines \nin all aspects of social life is not a necessary feature, nor even a typical \nfeature, of contemporary homosexual existence. For this reason, some \nmay be tempted to equate this phenomenon in Native America not \nwith homosexual identity, but rather with transgender identity.13 This \nequivocation is mitigated by significant cultural differences: whereas \nZuni lhamanas and similar people in other Native American tribes were \nrevered as sacred, transgender identity in contemporary US culture is \noften met with sympathy, fear, ridicule, contempt, and even violence.\nBeyond the Paradigm\nCategories of sexual identity are unique to the cultural contexts through \nwhich they are defined. Contemporary western categories of sexual \nidentity are usefully applied only to social contexts in which people define \nthemselves and are defined by others in terms of their sexual desires \nand pleasures, when those definitions are analogous to the definitions \nsupplied by contemporary western categories of sexual identity, and \nwhen those definitions generate experiences and expectations analogous \nto those associated with contemporary western categories of sexual \nidentity. Phenomena such as pederasty in ancient Greece and gender-\ncrossing in Native America suggest not that homosexuality is historically \nand culturally universal but rather that categories of sexual identity \nare historically and culturally specific. In other words, such examples \nsuggest that categories of sexual identity are socially constructed.\nAdditional support for social construction is supplied by examples in \nwhich different cultures apply the nomenclature of sexual orientation \ndifferently. In mainstream US culture, for instance, men who engage in \noral or anal sex with other men are generally labelled as gay – or perhaps \nbisexual, depending on whether they also engage sexually with women. \nAccording to Roger Lancaster (1987) and others (Almaguer, 1991; \nCarrier, 1976), however, this is not the case in Latin America where men \nwho take the penetrative role in oral or anal sex with other men do \nnot always identify as gay. While the receptive partner is stigmatized \nas passive, feminine, and therefore homosexual, there is no special \ncategory to describe the penetrative partner, who ‘is not stigmatized \nat all’ (Lancaster, 1987, p.113), despite a cultural stricture against \n",

A similar discontinuity between sexual behaviour and \nsexual identity has been documented in connection with some US Latino \nand Black subcultures (Hammonds, 1986; King, 2005).\nMany regard such inconsistencies between sexual activity and sexual \nidentity as prima facie14 evidence of deceit. Given the social stigma \nagainst homosexual identity, it is not surprising that some people hide \ntheir homosexual desires from others and even, in some cases, from \nthemselves. It is especially unfortunate that people occasionally achieve \nor maintain positions of power by publicly denouncing homosexuality \ndespite their own privately homosexual existence. Such instances of \nblatant duplicity notwithstanding, there are also people whose sexuality \nis not adequately or accurately represented by either of the available \nidentity categories – and the introduction of the intermediate third \ncategory of bisexuality does not always resolve the discrepancy. Consider \nostensibly heterosexual women whose arousal is linked to fantasies \nabout other women, or ostensibly heterosexual men whose arousal is \nlinked to wearing feminine lingerie. Consider apparently heterosexual \nwomen who gain little pleasure from sexual relationships with men but \nsubmit to them for financial or social reasons, or apparently homosexual \nwomen who would gain much pleasure from sexual relationships with \nmen but resist them for personal or political reasons. Also consider \npresumably heterosexual men who would gain equal pleasure from \npenetrating women, men, children, non-human animals, or inanimate \nobjects, but for moral or legal reasons engage in sexual relationships with \nwomen only. Likewise consider allegedly bisexual women whose sexual \nrelationships with other women give them only the indirect pleasure of \nserving the voyeuristic desires of their male partners. Consider those who \nadmit that they had mutually satisfying sexual experiences with partners \nof the opposite sex before they ‘came out’ as lesbian or gay. Consider \nthose with a distinct sexual preference for masculine women or feminine \nmen, for transgender women or men, or for intersex partners. Finally, \nconsider those for whom dominance or submission in the context of \na bondage relationship is a more significant concern than the sex of a \npotential partner.\nThe identity categories bisexual, homosexual, and heterosexual neglect \nsomething significant about the sexuality of the people represented in \nthese examples. For every case of wilful deception, there are perhaps far \nmore in which people identify to themselves or to others as homosexual, \nbisexual, or heterosexual simply because more fitting categories are \nunavailable. The assumption that every perceived mismatch between \nsexual activity and sexual identity is an instance of deceit reflects and \nreinforces the essentialist thesis by taking for granted that the existing \ncatalogue of identity categories provides an exhaustive and exclusive \ninventory of sexual possibilities.

In a more abstract \nsense, essentialism dates at least as far back as the ancient Greek philosopher \nPlato, who maintained that all general terms or categories reflect universal, \neternal, pure, divine archetypes. Plato referred to these archetypes as Forms \nor Ideas, depending on the translation. This version of essentialism is usually \ncontrasted with nominalism, according to which the only thing that unites \nthe disparate members of any category is the contingent social fact that they \nhappen to be given the same name.

Feeling the tail, one person \nemploys the conceptual framework of a rope while, feeling the leg, another \nemploys the conceptual framework of a tree, and so on. Without a conceptual \nframework that takes the whole elephant into account, they are unable to fully \nunderstand the individual components. To understand the tail as a tail, rather \nthan a rope, requires a shift in paradigm. \n8\t It is also useful to differentiate between descriptive and prescriptive forms of \nrelativism. While descriptive relativism amounts to the fairly uncontroversial \nnotion that beliefs and practices vary from person to person and from culture \nto culture, prescriptive relativism therefore concludes that no meaningful \ndistinction can be made between better and worse beliefs and practices. Not \nevery reference to relativism goes to the extreme of eliminating the distinction \nbetween fact and fiction, but there is a prevalent concern that challenging \nnotions of absolute truth and objective reality begins the descent down a \nslippery slope in that direction. \n9\t Although it is not necessarily the case that every theory and every paradigm \nis consistent with the empirical evidence, it is often the case that multiple \ntheories and multiple paradigms are consistent with the empirical evidence. \nFor this reason, evidence alone is often insufficient to determine the choice of \none theory or one paradigm over another.

These men came to be known as ‘mollies’ and \ntheir gathering places as ‘molly houses’. ‘The molly houses’, according \nto Bray, ‘were scattered across the whole of the built up area north of \nthe Thames’ (1995, p.84) and they ‘merged into a coherent social milieu’ \n(1995, p.85). Mollies and molly houses eventually attracted the attention \nof the Societies for the Reformation of Manners, a religious organization \nthat existed to ‘lay information before the magistrates against sabbath-\nbreakers, drunkenness and debauchery’ (Bray, 1995, p.89). In 1726, this \nattention led to a series of raids, arrests, and trials, and it culminated in \nthe execution of those found guilty of sodomy or buggery.2\nAlthough religious condemnation of sodomy was not new, according \nto Bray, the distinct subculture associated with the molly houses provided \na specifiable target for existing hostilities: \n",

In contrast, the \nsocially diffused homosexuality of the earlier seventeenth century \nwas far less obtrusive…. Its successor in the world of molly houses \nwas something that could easily be seen, and it was this that brought \nupon it the persecution which for so long had been often no more \nthan an unrealised potential. Its visibility was its bane. \n(Bray, 1995, p.92) \nPrior to the emergence of this new subculture, sodomy was thought of \nas a ‘disorder in sexual relations that, in principle, at least, could break \nout anywhere’ (Bray, 1995, p.25). The transfer of negative attitudes \nassociated with sodomy onto this subculture marked the evolution of \nhomosexuality as a social role.\nMcIntosh’s ‘The Homosexual Role’ was among the earliest published \naccounts of the social construction of homosexual identity, but it took \nalmost a decade and the publication of Michel Foucault’s The History \nof Sexuality, Volume 1 (released in French in 1976 and first translated \ninto English in 1977) for the thesis to gain momentum. Unlike McIntosh, \nwho regarded homosexuality as an 18th-century innovation, Foucault \nsupplied a later date and a different causal mechanism. According to \nFoucault, homosexual identity emerged in connection with the scientific \nresearch of the late 19th century.3 Informed by both McIntosh and \nFoucault, Bray pursued McIntosh’s suggestion that homosexuality \nemerged in connection with the molly houses of the early 18th century, \nand thereby provided an alternative to Foucault’s increasingly popular \naccount of the origin of homosexual identity.\nFoucault’s analysis of the discourses surrounding sexuality during \nthe Victorian era4 and into the 20th century (Foucault, 1990) is widely \ncelebrated as the first detailed articulation of the social construction of \nhomosexuality. Foucault used the term discourse, not simply in reference \nto dialogue or discussion, but instead to refer more broadly to ‘ways \nof constituting knowledge, together with the social practices, forms of \nsubjectivity and power relations which inhere in such knowledges and \nrelations between them’ (Weedon, 1987, p.108). Although the Victorians \nare usually portrayed as sexually repressed, Foucault noted that a variety \nof discourses about sexuality began to emerge and multiply during the \n19th century. Describing this period in terms of its growing preoccupation \nwith sexuality, Foucault challenged the commonly accepted ‘repressive \nhypothesis’, which alleges that a gradual repression of sexuality began \nin the 17th century, reached its peak during the Victorian period, and is \nfinally beginning to give way to more reasonable attitudes.\n",

First, ‘Is sexual repression truly an established historical fact? \nIs what first comes into view – and consequently permits one to advance \nan initial hypothesis – really the accentuation or even the establishment \nof a regime of sexual repression beginning in the seventeenth century?’ In \naddition, ‘Do the workings of power, and in particular those mechanisms \nthat are brought into play in societies such as ours, really belong primarily \nto the category of repression? Are prohibition, censorship, and denial \ntruly the forms through which power is exercised in a general way, if not \nin every society, most certainly in our own?’ And finally, ‘Did the critical \ndiscourse that addresses itself to repression come to act as a roadblock \nto a power mechanism that had operated unchallenged up to that point, \nor is it not in fact part of the same historical network as the thing it \ndenounces (and doubtlessly misrepresents) by calling it “repression”? \nWas there really a historical rupture between the age of repression and \nthe critical analysis of repression?’ (1990, p.10)\nThe repressive hypothesis ignores what Foucault (1990), borrowing an \nexpression from Steven Marcus (1966), referred to as the ‘other Victorians’. \nNot only prostitutes, pimps, and their clients, but also psychiatrists and \ntheir patients, as well as many others with an unmistakable interest in \nsexuality, serve as counter-examples to the alleged ubiquity of repression \namong Victorians. As Foucault was quick to explain, however, the \nrelevant issue is not so much to determine whether sexuality is affirmed \nor denied, encouraged or discouraged, but rather ‘to account for the fact \nthat it is spoken about, to discover who does the speaking, the positions \nand viewpoints from which they speak, the institutions which prompt \npeople to speak about it and which store and distribute the things \nthat are said’ (1990, p.11). As it turns out, much of the 19th-century \ndiscourse surrounding sexuality was created and controlled by various \nscientific and pseudo-scientific disciplines concerned with delineating \nthe boundaries between acceptable (normal, natural) and unacceptable \n(peripheral, perverse) forms of sexuality.\nThrough the various discourses, legal sanctions against minor \nperversions were multiplied; sexual irregularity was annexed \nto mental illness; from childhood to old age, a norm of sexual \ndevelopment was defined and all possible deviations were \ncarefully described; pedagogical controls and medical treatments \nwere organized; around the least fantasies, moralists, but \nespecially doctors, brandished the whole emphatic vocabulary of \nabomination. \n(Foucault, 1990, p.36)\nThe ‘persecution of the peripheral sexualities’ (Foucault, 1990, p.42) \nestablished ‘a new specification of individuals’ (1990, pp.42–3).\n",

With the new specification of individuals, the pervert – rather, a \nvast range of perverts – came into existence.5\nThe nineteenth-century homosexual became a personage, a past, \na case history, and a childhood, in addition to being a type of life, \na life form, and a morphology, with an indiscreet anatomy and \npossibly a mysterious physiology. Nothing that went into his total \ncomposition was unaffected by his sexuality. It was everywhere \npresent in him: at the root of all his actions because it was their \ninsidious and indefinitely active principle; written immodestly on \nhis face and body because it was a secret that always gave itself \naway. It was consubstantial with him, less as a habitual sin than as \na singular nature. \n(Foucault, 1990, p.43)\nFor Foucault, then, contemporary western conceptions of homosexuality \nemerged with the formulation and proliferation of discourses on sexuality, \nparticularly medical discourses, during a period associated, ironically, \nwith the suppression of sexuality.\nFollowing Foucault, John D’Emilio (1983) rejected the ‘myth of the \n“eternal homosexual”’ (p.101) and associated the advent of homosexual \nidentity with the late 19th century. Unlike Foucault, however, D’Emilio \nattributed this development to the emergence of capitalism and wage \nlabour, through which people gained independence from the more \ntraditional extended family household.\nI want to argue that gay men and lesbians have not always existed. \nInstead, they are a product of history, and have come into existence \nin a specific historical era. Their emergence is associated with the \nrelations of capitalism; it has been the historical development of \ncapitalism – more specifically, its free labor system – that has allowed \nlarge numbers of men and women in the late twentieth century to \ncall themselves gay, to see themselves as part of a community of \nsimilar men and women, and to organize politically on the basis \nof that identity. \n(D’Emilio, 1983, p.102) \nWith capitalism came a gradual shift away from the family farm as the \nunit of production.

No longer a matter \nof economic necessity, the family became a retreat from the ‘public world \nof work and production’ (D’Emilio, 1983, p.103). \nIn addition, the significance of procreation waned because the labour \nof children was no longer necessary. According to D’Emilio, this led to \nchanging attitudes about the role of sexual relations within marriage.\nThe meaning of heterosexual relations also changed. In colonial \nNew England, the birthrate averaged over seven children per woman \nof childbearing age. Men and women needed the labor of children. \nProducing offspring was as necessary for survival as producing grain. \nSex was harnessed to procreation. The puritans did not celebrate \nheterosexuality but rather marriage; they condemned all sexual \nexpression outside the marriage bond and did not differentiate \nsharply between sodomy and heterosexual fornication. \n(D’Emilio, 1983, p.104)\nSexual relations, which no longer served an essential economic function, \njoined the family unit as a source of intimacy in a private space clearly \ndelineated from the public world. There is evidence that various forms of \nsexual expression associated with homosexuality occurred in earlier times \n(D’Emilio, 1983, p.104), but only when individuals came to represent \nisolated economic agents did it become possible ‘to remain outside the \nheterosexual family and to construct a personal life based on attraction \nto one’s own sex’ (D’Emilio, 1983, p.105). \nLike McIntosh, Bray, and Foucault, D’Emilio drew a distinction \nbetween sexual activity and sexual identity. Again like McIntosh, Bray, \nand Foucault, D’Emilio noted that, although homosexual activity was \nnot condoned prior to the evolution of a specifically homosexual identity, \nit also was not condemned more harshly than other transgressions, such \nas promiscuity and adultery. In Bray’s words, ‘temptation to debauchery, \nfrom which homosexuality was not distinguished, was accepted as part of \nthe common lot’ (Bray, 1995, p.16). To put it another way, homosexuality \nwas regarded, not as a form of deviance, but as a form of indulgence. \nRegardless of its origins, the emergence of homosexuality as an identity \ncategory resulted in a contrast between heterosexual desire as normal or \nnatural and homosexual desire as abnormal or unnatural.\nThe specification of seemingly different causal factors by McIntosh and \nBray, Foucault, and D’Emilio does not render their analyses incompatible. \nThe time frame for the inception of homosexual identity supplied by \nD’Emilio coincides with the time frame supplied by Foucault, though \nD’Emilio attributed causality to changing social structures and Foucault \nattributed it to the emerging medical discourses.

Indeed, the industrial revolution, which was \nthe background for the transition from family farming to wage labour, \nwas characterized by a sense of optimism regarding the use of science \nand technology to improve the human condition. Thus, the proliferation \nof medical discourses simultaneous with industrialization and the wage \nlabour system was hardly a matter of mere coincidence. According to \nMcIntosh and Bray, homosexual identity emerged much earlier, but \nonly in a developed part of London during a period of urban growth. \nIf the urban lifestyle associated with industrialization contributed to the \ndevelopment of homosexual identity, then it makes sense that it would \nhave appeared in this particular region before reaching other parts \nof England or the USA. While neither Bray nor D’Emilio explain the \nemergence of homosexual identity among poor men or men in rural areas, \nthey do offer a plausible explanation of the emergence of a collective gay \nidentity for at least some men at the time.\nSocial Histories of Lesbian Identity\nHomosexuality is not, in principle, a gendered concept. Theoretically, \nit refers equally to female homosexuality and male homosexuality. \nNevertheless, the social histories supplied by McIntosh, Bray, and \nFoucault are concentrated almost exclusively on male homosexual \nidentity. D’Emilio’s (1983) discussion is the exception, reserving the \ngeneric term, homosexual, for reference to both women and men, \nand substituting the gendered terms, lesbian and gay,6 to differentiate \nbetween the two. In addition, D’Emilio dealt directly, albeit briefly, with \nthe evolution of lesbian identity. According to D’Emilio, the evolution of \nlesbian identity, like the evolution of gay male identity, became possible \nonly with economic independence from the traditional family structure. \nDespite the shift to the wage labour system, however, many women \nremained financially dependent on men well into the 20th century. Still \nrelegated to the private world of home and family, women lacked access \nto the social world of taverns and public houses in which the parameters \nof the male homosexual role seem to have been negotiated. \nIt is therefore not surprising that, until fairly recently, female \nhomosexuality did not attract as much attention as male homosexuality. \nAccording to Annamarie Jagose, ‘female homosexuality does not occupy \nthe same positions as male homosexuality in the discourses of law or \nmedicine’ (Jagose, 1996, p.13).

The Labouchère Amendment of 1885, on which \nmuch current anti-homosexual western legislation is founded, \nspecifically outlaws acts of ‘gross indecency’ between ‘male \npersons,’ but leaves comparable acts between female persons \nlegal by default. Similarly – and partly as a consequence of its \ndifferent relation to criminalisation – female homosexuality took \nmuch longer than male homosexuality to constitute the basis of a \ncommunal, subcultural identity. \n(Jagose, 1996, p.13)\nThe medical community did not acknowledge female homosexuality \nuntil late 19th- and early 20th-century sexologists addressed what they \nreferred to as ‘sexual inversion’, a condition believed to be characterized \nby the complete reversal of gender, including sexual attraction toward \nmembers of the same sex. In particular, Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s \nPsychopathia Sexualis was published in German in 1886 and in English \nin 1892 (Krafft-Ebing, 2007), and Havelock Ellis’ Sexual Inversion was \npublished in 1897 (Ellis, 2007). The ideas of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis were \nthen popularized in Radclyffe Hall’s 1928 novel The Well of Loneliness \n(Hall, 1990), for which Ellis wrote the foreword. The confusion felt by \nthe novel’s protagonist, Stephen, a masculine woman who experiences \nsexual love for other women, reflects the absence, outside of the medical \ncommunity, of a clearly defined female homosexual social role. The \ndecision to ban the book in both the UK and the USA suggests that \nat least some people were reluctant to entertain the concept of female \nhomosexuality, while the publication in England of three additional \nlesbian-themed novels7 in 1928 suggests that others had already begun \nto extend the distinction between homosexuality and heterosexuality to \nfemale sexuality.\nUnder the old paradigm, there was no concept of female homosexuality. \nAs described by Vicinus, however, there were at least four distinct \ncharacterizations of 18th-century European and North American \nwomen who deviated from traditional feminine roles. First, there was \nthe ‘passing woman’ who dressed as a man and, often enough, was \nsufficiently convincing to obtain work, freedom, or the opportunity to \nserve in the military.\nEighteenth-century broadside ballads praised the ‘female warrior’ \nwho went into battle in order to find her beloved.

Third, there was the sexually ‘free woman’. \n‘Her appearance and behavior could signal an erotic interest in women, \nbut at other times – as prostitute, courtesan, or mistress – she chose men’ \n(Vicinus, 1992, p.475). Finally, there were women engaged in ‘romantic \nfriendship’, as outlined by Lillian Faderman in Surpassing the Love of \nMen (1981). According to Vicinus, these four characterizations ‘were \nunited less by the behavior or attitudes of the women than by the ways in \nwhich men interpreted women’s same-sex desire’ (1992, p.477).\nLillian Faderman (1981) noted that, prior to the 20th century, female \nromantic friendships, which may or may not have involved sexual intimacy, \nwere not merely ignored, but were actually encouraged. Faderman \nsuggested that public recognition of the possibility of sexual intimacy \nwithin female romantic friendships, and corresponding condemnation \nof such friendships, occurred only in response to the demand for social \nchange issued by the first wave of feminism.8 This is consistent with Martha \nVicinus’ (1992) claim that condemnation of female homosexuality, when \nit occurs, is a direct result of male insecurities. ‘Only when a woman \nseemed to contravene directly masculine priorities and privileges was she \npunished’ (Vicinus, 1992, p.477).\nFor both Faderman and Vicinus, public recognition and condemnation \nof lesbian identity represented a hostile reaction, or backlash, against \nactual or perceived threats to male authority and privilege. For D’Emilio, \nthe formation of lesbian identity, like the formation of gay male identity, \nbecame possible as the result of increased independence from the traditional \nfamily structure.

The Married Women’s Property Act allowed women \nto retain control over their own property after marriage, thus granting \nat least some women greater economic independence from men while \nsimultaneously threatening the authority and privilege of at least some \nmen. The National Woman Suffrage Association was formed in 1869, \nfollowed by the American Woman Suffrage Association.

Unlike D’Emilio, however, Faderman and Vicinus drew \nattention to the role of what Suzanne Pharr (1988) referred to as lesbian-\nbaiting. Lesbian-baiting occurs when women are labelled as lesbians, \nnot for engaging sexually with other women, but for other perceived \nviolations of assigned gender roles. In particular, women who embody \nfeminist principles are often characterized as lesbians. By equating \nfeminist identity with lesbian identity, lesbian-baiting is an attempt, \noften successful, to capitalize on negative attitudes about homosexuality \nto prevent women from identifying as feminists.\nEven if public recognition and condemnation of lesbian identity was \nlargely a matter of lesbian-baiting and backlash, there was a growing \npopulation of women who enjoyed the requisite independence to gather \nwith other women and, in some cases, forge lesbian identities that would \nhave been impossible in earlier generations. Despite the existence of \nwomen who now identified and were identified by others as homosexual, \nthey seem to have been more isolated and dispersed than the men who \nparticipated in the formation of a cohesive and recognizable gay male \nsubculture. This lack of cohesion among lesbian women is reflected in the \nfact that, Faderman’s discussion of female romantic friendships aside, little \nattempt has been made to offer a single account of the social construction \nof female homosexual identity. Instead, a number of ethnographic \nstudies have addressed the evolution of lesbian identity in specific, local \ncontexts. In Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold, for example, Elizabeth \nKennedy and Madeline Davis (1993) detail the experiences of women \nwho were part of the working-class lesbian subculture in Buffalo, New \nYork, during the 1940s and 50s. Similarly, in Cherry Grove, Fire Island, \nEsther Newton (1993) offers an account of life in what was perhaps \nthe first lesbian and gay resort community in the USA. In addition to \nethnographic studies, there are many autobiographical accounts tracing \nthe evolution of lesbian identity in the lives of particular women. \nIsolated expressions of lesbian identity were not unified by a cohesive \nand recognizable subculture, and emerging cultural ideas about lesbian \nidentity were not unified by a single set of expectations.

With respect to gay \nmale identity, a single stereotype dominates mainstream culture, and \nthis stereotype has changed very little, if at all, since the 17th-century \ncharacterization of homosexual men as mollies. While many gay men \nseek to distance themselves from this stereotype, both lesbian women \nand feminist women who attempt to distance themselves from one of the \nstereotypes – for example, of lesbian women as objects of heterosexual \nmale fantasy – inevitably find themselves situated that much closer to \nanother stereotype – for example, of feminist women as the antithesis to \nheterosexual male desire. This is a concern for lesbian women, regardless \nof whether they identify as feminists, and for feminist women, regardless \nof whether they identify as lesbians.\nThe point of this observation is not to suggest that the expectations \nassociated with lesbian identity are any more or less restrictive than those \nassociated with gay male identity, but simply to note that they are less \nconsistent and less cohesive than the expectations associated with gay \nmale identity. Precisely because they are neither consistent nor cohesive, \nhowever, they demonstrate that there is room within contemporary \nwestern culture to accommodate multiple interpretations of lesbian \nidentity and, presumably, of other sexual identities as well. This serves as \nan invitation to introduce alternative interpretations of sexual identities \nthat lie outside the heterosexual norm, particularly interpretations \nthat will better serve the interests of those who do not conform to the \nheterosexual norm. In other words, it serves as an invitation to construct \nan alternative paradigm of sexuality. More specifically, it is an invitation \nto construct a paradigm in which those who identify as lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and heterosexual – regardless of whether they are transgender \nmen and women, biological women and men, or intersex persons – along \nwith those who define their sexuality in different terms or not all, may at \nthe same time exhibit characteristics and express themselves in ways that \nmight be deemed feminine, masculine, both, or neither.\nAdditional Resources \nFoucault, M.

It nevertheless offers the benefit of mimicking the order in which these \nidentity categories entered the collective consciousness of western culture. \nWhile gay identity was hidden throughout much of history, lesbian identity \nremained hidden for even longer, and this is reflected in the way the material \nunfolds throughout this chapter.\n2\t Today, sodomy is often used to refer specifically to anal sex, but it also refers \nmore generally to any sexual intercourse other than when penis is received by \nvagina. Buggery, used primarily in England, has similar connotations.\n3\t More specifically, Foucault cited the 1870 publication of an article by Westphal \nas the date homosexuality first emerged (Foucault, 1990, p.43).\n4\t The Victorian era is associated with the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 \nto 1901 during what many regard as the height of the British Empire. The \ntransition from agriculture to industry during this period had tremendous \nimpact on political interests, economic relations, class structure, and many \nother aspects of social life.\n5\t In keeping with the 19th-century trend of proliferating perversions, the \ncontemporary sexologist John Money has generated a list of more than fifty \nspecific paraphilias (1988, pp.179–80). Although the use of the term paraphilia \navoids making outdated reference to perversion, it nevertheless refers to \n‘unusual and personally or socially unacceptable’ forms of sexual pleasure and \ndesire (Money, 1988, p.216).\n6\t Gay is sometimes used, like homosexual, to refer to homosexuality among \nwomen as well as men. More often, however, gay is used in reference \nto homosexuality among men, whereas lesbian is used in reference to \nhomosexuality among women.\n7\t Following the publication of Radclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness, Elizabeth \nBowen’s The Hotel, Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, and Compton MacKenzie’s \nExtraordinary Women, all of which contained lesbian themes, were also \npublished in England in 1928.\n8\t A distinction is often drawn between the first, second, and third waves of \nfeminism. The first wave refers to the women’s movement of the 19th and \nearly 20th centuries, which gained its greatest momentum in connection with \nwomen’s suffrage, or voting rights, in the USA. Enthusiasm waned following \nthe ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, but momentum returned in the \nearly 1960s in connection with growing concern over the persistence of women’s \nsocial and economic oppression. There is disagreement about whether feminism \nhas entered yet a third wave. While some regard contemporary feminism as a \ncontinuation of the second wave, others regard the recent attention to differences \namong women’s definitions of self as an emerging hallmark of the third wave \nand a break from the legal and economic concerns of an earlier generation. \nThird-wave feminism is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.\n9\t Examples include Lucretia Mott, Ernestine Rose, and Elizabeth Cady \nStanton.\n10\tFor a more thorough examination of the first wave of the women’s movement, \nrefer to the edited collection Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings \n(Schneir, 1994).\n11\tThe reference to mainstream pornography, rather than a reference simply to \npornography, recognizes that attempts have been made to produce pornography \nfrom a feminist perspective and without the usual sexist trappings.\n",

Recognizing that sexuality, like science, is a human \npractice, a useful analogy can be drawn between paradigm change in \nthe context of science and paradigm change in the context of sexuality. \nThe term practice is used here not in reference to repetition or rehearsal, \nbut rather to patterns of social behaviour and interaction.

Just as Marx \nmade reference to revolutionary practice, Kuhn made reference to \nrevolutionary science. For Kuhn, normal scientific practice, characterized \nby consensus around an established paradigm, is contrasted with \nrevolutionary scientific practice, characterized by crisis and conflict.\nA parallel exists between paradigm change, or revolution, in the \ncontext of scientific practice and paradigm change, or revolution, in the \nlarger context of political practice:\nPolitical revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, often \nrestricted to a segment of the political community, that existing \ninstitutions have ceased adequately to meet the problems posed by \nan environment that they have in part created. In much the same \nway, scientific revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, again \noften restricted to a narrow subdivision of the scientific community, \n",

Similarly, \nthe established paradigm of sexuality, which initially provided a tidy \ndistinction between homosexuality as deviant and heterosexuality \nas normal, has ceased to accommodate the various and often subtle \nways in which sexuality deviates from the heterosexual norm. This is \nespecially clear in connection with transgender identity. Consider, for \nexample, the tendency to classify Hall’s The Well of Loneliness as a \n‘lesbian novel’, though its protagonist exhibits an identity that could just \nas readily be characterized as transgender. The conflation of transgender \nand homosexual identities is consistent with the late 19th- and early \n20th-century account of ‘sexual inversion’, but it is inconsistent with \nthe existence of lesbian women and gay men who are otherwise typical \nin terms of gender expression. It is also inconsistent with the existence \nof transgender men and women whose sexuality is oriented toward \nmembers of the same gender category to which they have transitioned.\nIn the context of science, Kuhn noted, there ‘are always difficulties in the \nparadigm-nature fit’, but these are usually resolved in the course of normal \nscientific practice (1970, p.82). The fit between paradigm and nature, or \nbetween theories and facts, is never perfect, and much of normal scientific \npractice, and perhaps much of normal practice in other contexts, consists of \nwhat Kuhn referred to as the ‘mop-up work’ (1970, p.24) of extending and \narticulating the accepted paradigm. Not all messes are easily mopped up, \nhowever, and not all mismatches between paradigm and nature are easily \nreconciled. When an especially stubborn mismatch between paradigm and \nnature ‘comes to seem more than just another puzzle of normal science’, \naccording to Kuhn, ‘the transition to crisis and to extraordinary science \nhas begun’ (1970, p.82). Kuhn maintained that ‘all crises begin with the \nblurring of a paradigm and the consequent loosening of the rules for normal \nresearch’ (p.84). Perhaps at least some perceived mismatches between sexual \nidentity and sexual behaviour represent especially stubborn mismatches \nbetween paradigm and nature. Perhaps they represent a blurring of the \nparadigm of sexuality and a consequent loosening of the rules for applying \nthe categories of sexual identity. Perhaps, then, contemporary western \nculture has entered a period of crisis in connection with the paradigm by \nwhich sexual practice is characterized.\nKuhn claimed that, within scientific practice, closure to such crises \ninevitably follows one of three paths. First, the problem that provoked \nthe crisis may be resolved in the course of normal science, often through \n",

Second, the unresolved problem may \nbe set aside with the expectation that eventually it will submit to the \nefforts of normal science. Finally, an alternative paradigm may emerge, \nalong with ‘the ensuing battle over its acceptance’ (Kuhn, 1970, p.84). \nIn the first case, the problem is resolved by making adjustments to the \nexisting paradigm. In the third case, the problem is resolved by replacing \nthe existing paradigm. If resolution is finally achieved in the second case, \nin which the problem is merely postponed, it would seem to constitute \nan extension of the first case; if resolution is not achieved before the \nparadigm is replaced, it would seem to constitute an extension of the \nthird case. Ultimately, then, crisis resolution demands either a change \nwithin the existing paradigm or a more revolutionary transition to an \nalternative paradigm.\nIndeed, the accepted paradigm of sexuality has undergone a series \nof adjustments in an effort to account for the existence of a wide range \nof people who do not conform to the heterosexual norm. Consider the \nexpanded and expanding inventory of identities collectively addressed \nin connection with the effort to secure freedom of sexual expression.1 \nAn early example of such effort is found in the homophile movement \nof the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Homosexual men began to \nform homophile organizations in Europe ‘in the same period in which \nhomosexuality crystallised as an identity, when for the first time it was \npossible to be a homosexual’ (Jagose, 1996, p.22). These organizations \nupheld the rights of homosexuals by noting the consensus within the \nmedical community around the notion of homosexuality as a condition \nthat is congenital, or present from the time of birth (Jagose, 1996, p.22). \nSome resented the clinical connotations of the term homosexual, however, \nalong with the apologetic attitude (Jagose, 1996, p.27) of the homophile \nmovement. Gay identity thus emerged as an alternative to homosexual \nidentity, and the gay liberation movement emerged as an alternative to \nthe homophile movement.\nAlthough it is an over-simplification, the Stonewall riots of 1969 \nare often cited as the beginning of the gay liberation movement. The \nStonewall Inn was a New York gay and drag bar, predominately Black and \nLatino, and it was subject, like many gay bars at the time, to occasional \npolice raids. These raids usually resulted in arrests for such forms of \n‘indecency’ as dancing, kissing, and cross-dressing. When Stonewall was \nraided in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, however, the patrons \nfought back, and they continued fighting all weekend. This sudden and \nunanimous expression of outrage is sometimes attributed to the death of \ngay icon Judy Garland,2 whose funeral was held on 27 June 1969, but a \nmore likely explanation is that these riots, as well as the gay liberation \nmovement and other movements of the same era, including the women’s \nliberation movement and the Black civil rights movement, were evidence \nof a growing sense of injustice in response to discrimination.3\n",

    "chunk_full": " \n31\nQueer Alternatives\nThis same sense of injustice eventually motivated an addition to the \nterminology associated with homosexual identity. Although ‘gay’ can be \nused in reference to women as well as men, the gay liberation movement \nwas mainly concentrated on and directed toward gay men, and many \nlesbian women wanted the movement to recognize and include lesbian \nidentity more explicitly. As a result of this demand, homosexual identity is \nusually referred to in terms of both lesbian identity and gay male identity. \nUnlike references to gay identity, which could include lesbian women, \nreferences to gay men and lesbian women are explicitly inclusive.\nWhile more inclusive than ‘gay’, references to gay and lesbian identity \ndo not reflect the full range of alternatives to heterosexuality. Given \nthe popular misconception that bisexuality is a temporary identity that \npeople eventually overcome, either by fully committing to homosexuality \nor by fully committing to heterosexuality, it is especially important to \nassert bisexuality as a sexual identity distinct from both heterosexuality \nand homosexuality. In order to encompass a broader range of identities \nand issues, references to alternative sexualities were expanded to include \nbisexual identity. A drawback of this expanded terminology is that it \nis longer and somewhat more awkward than referring to gay, or even \ngay and lesbian, identities. For this reason, the abbreviation GLB was \nintroduced to refer to gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities. Recognizing \nthat women always seem to come second, some people preferred to \nrearrange the order the letters, LGB, symbolically putting women ahead \nof men.\nThe recent addition of transgender identity completes a now familiar \nlist, GLBT or LGBT. Unlike lesbian, gay, and bisexual, the category of \ntransgender does not address sexual partner choice. Instead, it addresses \nthe discrepancy some people experience between the biological sex \ncategory to which they were assigned and their identification as women or \nmen. The inclusion of transgender people when accounting for alternative \nsexualities is not altogether arbitrary, however. Many who identify as \nlesbian, gay, or bisexual experience discrimination and violence for \ndeviating from the heterosexual norm, and this is also the case for those \nwho identify as transgender. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \nidentities all challenge the widespread expectation that biological females \nand biological males should exhibit the specific collection of attitudes \nand behaviours assigned to each sex category, and that they should \npartner sexually only with biological members of the opposite sex and \ncorresponding gender categories.\nThe paradigm that initially established a deceptively simple distinction \nbetween homosexuality and heterosexuality has been expanded to \nencompass a broader range of people who deviate from the heterosexual \nnorm. If this is sufficient to salvage the established paradigm, it will serve \nas an example of Kuhn’s claim that some crises can be resolved by making \nadjustments to the paradigm.

If retooling is not sufficient to \nsalvage the established paradigm, perhaps because the crisis is constituted \nby growing resentment over the very existence of the heterosexual norm, \nrather than by an easily corrected failure to name the various forms of \ndeviance from that norm, then it will serve as an example of Kuhn’s claim \nthat some crises can be resolved only by a thoroughgoing revolution in \nwhich the existing paradigm is replaced by an alternative paradigm. \nAlthough it is impossible to know the outcome of the current crisis from \nthe perspective of the present, adjustments to the established paradigm \nhave thus far failed to resolve the crisis and have led, not to resolution or \nthe promise thereof, but to further adjustments. \nRecognizing that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities, \nor LGBT identities, do not constitute an exhaustive or exclusive list of \nalternatives to the heterosexual norm, some amend the inventory by adding \nan additional category, such as ‘questioning’ or simply ‘other’. The addition \nof the questioning category suggests that sexual identities develop over time, \nperhaps as the result of experimentation or exploration. The addition of \nthe other category serves as a final attempt to cover any remaining sexual \nidentities inadvertently omitted from the itemized list. In yet another effort \nto save the established paradigm, reference to alternative sexualities now \nrefer to LGBTQ4 or LGBTO identities. The crisis seems to be unfolding \nas quickly as adjustments to the paradigm can be made, however, and yet \nanother mismatch between the paradigm and the human world reveals \nitself, this time in the form of intersex identity. Intersex, like transgender, \ndoes not address sexual partner choice and is not a sexual orientation in any \nstrict sense. Nevertheless, intersex people and transgender people, like those \nwho identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual, violate the heterosexual norm. \nThe heterosexual norm presupposes a distinction between biologically \nunproblematic women and biologically unproblematic men, and while \ntransgender people render that distinction problematic by identifying as \nmembers of a different category than biology has assigned, intersex people \nrender the distinction problematic because biology does not dictate a \nclear assignment to either sex category. The inclusion of intersex in the \nexpanding inventory of alternative sexual identities, like the inclusion of \ntransgender, therefore seems warranted. Those who have accepted this \nmost recent attempt to save the established paradigm sometimes refer to \nLGBTQI identities, while others simply hope that LGBTO is sufficiently \nvague to eliminate the need for further additions. \nQueer Theory\nThe ongoing need for such additions and adjustments may be an \nindication that the established paradigm can no longer be saved. \n",

    "chunk_full": " \n33\nQueer Alternatives\nDespite expanding the range of recognized alternatives to normative \nheterosexuality, recent attempts to salvage the paradigm ultimately \nreinforce a binary model of human sexuality. The model is binary in at \nleast two interrelated ways. First, it posits a social and sexual opposition \nbetween female and male, feminine and masculine.5 Second, it posits a \nsocial and sexual opposition between forms of sexual expression that \nreinforce the allegedly complementary opposition between female and \nmale, feminine and masculine, and forms of sexual expression that \ndisrupt this opposition. In a more thoroughly revolutionary alternative \nto the established paradigm, queer theory avoids binary and hierarchical \nreasoning in general, and in connection with gender, sex, and sexuality \nin particular.6 This is part of the reason why queer theory is notoriously \ndifficult to define. In philosophy, a successful definition is often \nunderstood as an articulation of the necessary and sufficient conditions \nunder which the term to be defined may be meaningfully and accurately \napplied. In other words, it draws an unproblematic boundary between the \nmembers of a given category and everything else, thereby participating \nin binary reasoning rather than transcending it. Queer theory, which \ntrades essentialism and semantic atomism for social constructionism and \nsemantic holism, recognizes that meaning is conveyed not by definitions \nof individual terms but by contextual relations between and among \nvarious terms. According to Jagose, ‘Broadly speaking, queer describes \nthose gestures or analytical models which dramatize incoherencies in \nthe allegedly stable relations between chromosomal sex, gender and \nsexual desire’ (Jagose, 1996, p.3). Although this is not a definition in the \ncustomary sense, it is an informative description nonetheless.7\nTaken literally, queer describes something as unusual or unexpected, \nbut it also has a history as a pejorative slur against those who violate \n– or are perceived as violating – the heterosexual norm. According to \nHalperin (2003), the pairing of the terms queer and theory is attributable \nto Teresa de Lauretis:\nQueer theory originally came into being as a joke. Teresa de \nLauretis coined the phrase ‘queer theory’ to serve as the title of a \nconference that she held in February of 1990 at the University of \nCalifornia, Santa Cruz, where she is Professor of The History of \nConsciousness. She had heard the word ‘queer’ being tossed about \nin a gay-affirmative sense by activists, street kids, and members \nof the art world in New York during the late 1980s. She had the \ncourage, and the conviction, to pair that scurrilous term with \nthe academic holy word, ‘theory.’ Her usage was scandalously \noffensive. Sympathetic faculty at UCSC asked, in wounded tones, \n‘Why do they have to call it that?’ But the conjunction was more \nthan merely mischievous: it was deliberately disruptive. \n(2003, pp.339–40)\n",

    "chunk_full": " \n34\nFeminism is Queer\nCalled into existence in this manner, queer theory needed something to \nwhich it could now actually refer. Foucault’s The History of Sexuality, \nVolume 1 (1990), which was first published in the 1970s, along with \nJudith Butler’s Gender Trouble (1990) and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s The \nEpistemology of the Closet (1990), which were published the same year \nthat de Lauretis organized the first queer theory conference, are regarded \nby many as the seminal texts of queer theory. Written before the first \ndocumented use of the term queer theory, they nevertheless serve as early \nexamples of the twofold attempt ‘to unsettle the complacency of “lesbian \nand gay studies”’ and ‘to challenge the heterosexist underpinnings and \nassumptions of what conventionally passed for “theory” in academic \ncircles’ (Halperin, 2003, p.340). \nQueer theory disrupts lesbian and gay studies, as well as women’s \nstudies, by avoiding binary contrasts between female and male, feminine \nand masculine, homosexual and heterosexual, and so on. Nevertheless, \nqueer theory is compatible with the existence of female and male \nidentities, butch and femme identities, homosexual and heterosexual \nidentities, transgender identities, and various other identities that \nexist, be it comfortably or uncomfortably, within the binary system. \nQuite simply, queer theory does not dictate the eradication of existing \ncategories of gender, sex, and sexuality, though many people assume that \nit must. Within queer theory, what is sometimes described as a rejection \nof binary contrasts is perhaps better described as social constructionism \nwith respect to those contrasts. Recall that essentialism is the belief \nthat various identity categories, such as female and male, feminine and \nmasculine, homosexual and heterosexual, reflect innate characteristics \nthat comprise the fundamental nature of the members of those categories, \nwhereas social constructionism is the belief that such identity categories \nare historical and cultural developments. This does not necessarily mean \nthat they have no empirical basis, but it does mean that the categories \nare empirically underdetermined.

Although there is an \nempirically observable difference between shaded and unshaded figures, \nand between rounded and angled figures, nothing empirical dictates \nreference to these features when determining which individuals belong \n",

Yet another way to challenge a binary opposition is to \nexpand the range of alternatives, trading duality for multiplicity. By \nchallenging the binary in this manner, queer theory is capable of resisting \nessentialism while simultaneously affirming the experiences of people for \nwhom the established categories are problematic as well as of people for \nwhom the established categories are unproblematic.\nRecognizing that sexuality is unique to each individual person, it is \ndifficult to believe that there is anyone whose sexuality is not unusual, \nunexpected, or somehow queer. It therefore makes sense to regard as \nqueer even some people who might otherwise be expected to identify \nas heterosexual. The point of this shift is not to allow heterosexuals to \nclaim homosexual identities if they decide they can gain some advantage \nby doing so. Instead, the point is to shift the balance of power, at least \nsymbolically, by acknowledging that far more of us are queer than not. \nBut queer theory is not just about increased inclusion. It is also about \nthe constant need to acknowledge that, while categories may be useful, \nperhaps even necessary, for understanding oneself and relating with \nothers, no particular category or set of categories is itself necessary, and \neven the most deeply entrenched categories are subject to revision.\nAdditional Resources \nKuhn, T.

It sometimes \nmakes reference to the sex categories into which people are organized, as \nconveyed by such expressions as ‘the female sex’ and ‘the male sex’. At \nother times, however, it makes reference to the various activities commonly \nrecognized as sex acts, as conveyed by such expressions as ‘vaginal sex’ \nand ‘oral sex’, as well as the familiar but oddly limiting phrase, ‘the \nsex act’. Etymologically, ‘sex’ derives from the same root as the word \n‘section’, as in to parse into sections. Taken from the Latin ‘sexus’, it \nrefers literally to division. Many words divide the world, or some part of \nit, into separate categories. Indeed, most, perhaps even all, nouns perform \nthis function by differentiating between what belongs inside the category \nto which the noun refers and what lies outside its boundaries. Unlike most \nother nouns, however, the term ‘sex’ makes direct reference to the process \nof parsing the world, and this carries an implicit suggestion that the way \nin which ‘sex’ parses the world is of utmost significance. It is not just any \nparsing; rather, it is a parsing that, at least in the English language, is \nacknowledged as the parsing. Moreover, the dual usage of the single term \n‘sex’ to refer both to what a someone is (in the case of sex categories) and \nalso to what someone does (in the case of sex acts) betrays the underlying \nassumption that, when it comes to sex, what someone is determines what \nthat person does and that, by the same token, what someone does is the \nultimate expression of what that person is at the most fundamental level. \nSex category membership is usually regarded as a biological \ncondition.

Genitals, gonads, chromosomes, \nand hormones are the main criteria by which specific people are \ncategorized as members of either sex. Genitals, gonads, chromosomes, \nand hormones are most often aligned such that the genitals, gonads, \nchromosomes, and hormones of any one person usually fit neatly into \nexactly one of the two sex categories. The biological archetype of the \nhuman female is someone with a clearly recognizable vagina (with no \ngenital structure that resembles a penis) and a uterus (with no structures \nthat resemble testicles), as well as an XX chromosome pattern and \nhormone levels that are within the range designated as normal for \nwomen. The male standard includes a penis (but no vaginal structure) \nand testicles (but no ovaries), along with an XY chromosome pattern \nand hormone levels similar to those found in other males.\nJudgments about the sex of other people usually come easily, and with \nremarkable accuracy considering that most ordinary situations do not \nprovide opportunities to examine the genitals, gonads, chromosomes, \nor hormones of others. Observable secondary sex characteristics, such \nas the presence or relative absence of facial hair and the presence \nor relative absence of breast tissue, provide some clues, but they do \nnot always provide adequate or accurate information. While many \nbiologically unambiguous males are unable to achieve a significant \ngrowth of facial hair, many biologically unambiguous females devote \nan inordinate amount of time and money to the task of removing it. \nThere is likewise considerable variability in the amount of breast tissue \nwith which people are endowed, regardless of whether they are female \nor male. Secondary sex characteristics and other observable bodily \nfeatures can be misleading. Despite a general tendency for males to \nbe larger, hairier, and more muscular than females, particular females \nare occasionally larger, hairier, and more muscular than particular \nmales. \nGiven that biological criteria for determining sex are not publicly \naccessible and secondary sex characteristics are not always reliable, it is \nremarkable that there is not more confusion when it comes to separating \npeople on the basis of sex. The ease with which most people can be \nrecognized as female or male has less to do with their biology than it \nhas to do with various social markers. Although anyone, female or \nmale, can wear a dress or a short hairstyle, such social displays are fairly \nreliable unless people consciously present themselves in an ambiguous \nmanner, which is sometimes referred to informally as genderfucking. \nWhen people make an earnest attempt to style themselves as women \nor to style themselves as men, however, there is rarely any doubt about \nwhich category they mean to embody – even if others do no approve of \ntheir effort, as is often the case when those who are biologically female \nstyle themselves as men or when those who are biologically male style \nthemselves as women.\n",

Furthermore, even when genetic testing \nis available, the sex category to which someone belongs is sometimes \nstill unclear. There are some people in whom the genitals, gonads, \nchromosomes, or hormones are in disagreement or are themselves \nso ambiguous that not even the medical experts agree about the best \nway to categorize them. Some people appear female despite having the \nXY chromosome pattern associated with males. People with androgen \ninsensitivity syndrome, for example, have both X and Y chromosomes, \nbut their bodies do not respond to male hormones, or androgens. As a \nresult, they usually have physical features, including genitals, that are \nmore readily recognizable as female than male.\nThe relationship between hormones and sex is complicated by the fact \nthat women and men produce the same hormones. It is only the amount \nof certain hormones, specifically oestrogens and androgens, that varies \naccording to sex. This means that there is no precise boundary between \nnormal and abnormal hormone levels for women and men:\nMen and women produce the same kinds of hormones, though \nusually in different relative quantities, but we know that all girls’ \nand women’s bodies do not uniformly produce a single identifiable \n‘feminine’ cocktail of hormones, nor do all boys and men produce \na single, identifiable sort of ‘masculine’ cocktail. To use hormones \nas a dividing line we would have to decide where to draw the \nboundaries of acceptable hormonal variations on malehood and \nfemalehood. \n(Dreger 1998b, p.7)\nIt can be difficult to differentiate between a large clitoris and a small \npenis, and assignment as male or female is sometimes a judgment call. \nThis is likewise the case for people endowed with testes or partial testes \nas well as a uterus or partial uterus. It is the case once again for people \nwho do not have a straightforward XX or XY chromosome pattern, but \ninstead have an XXY, XYY, or XXX pattern, or a even mosaic pattern \nin which some cells in the body are XX and others are XY. In other \nwords, there are exceptions and ambiguities regardless of whether sex \nis understood to be a function of genitals, gonads, chromosomes, or \nhormones.\nFor a very public example of the problematic use of chromosomes as \nthe basis for sex differentiation, consider recent discussions regarding \nthe International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) use of what has been \ndubbed ‘gender testing’, but which would more precisely be identified \nas ‘sex testing’ or, even more precisely, as ‘sex chromosome testing’ \n",

Since \nthat time, ‘two or three women have failed the test at virtually every \nOlympic competition and been disqualified for life’ (Kolata, 1992). It is \nunfortunate that, as far as most of these competitors knew, they were just \nordinary women who happened to be extraordinary athletes. To avoid \nsuch incidents, the IOC discontinued universal testing:\nAt the Atlanta games in 1996, eight female athletes failed sex \ntests but were all cleared on appeal; seven were found to have an \n‘intersex’ condition. As a result, by the time of the Sydney games \nin 2000, the IOC had abolished universal sex testing but, as will \nhappen in Beijing, some women still had to prove they really were \nwomen. \n(Saner, 2008)\nAccording to the Intersex Society of North America (ISNA), intersex \nrefers to a range of exceptions to the expected alignment of genitals, \ngonads, chromosomes, and hormones into exactly two distinct sex \ncategories, female and male.\n‘Intersex’ is a general term used for a variety of conditions in which \na person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t \nseem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, \na person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but \nhaving mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person \nmay be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual \nmale and female types – for example, a girl may be born with a \nnoticeably large clitoris, or lacking a vaginal opening, or a boy \nmay be born with a notably small penis, or with a scrotum that \nis divided so that it has formed more like labia. Or a person may \nbe born with mosaic genetics, so that some of her cells have XX \nchromosomes and some of them have XY. \n(ISNA, n.d.)\nSuch exceptions are rare, but they are more common than many people \nrealize. According to most official estimates, intersex conditions occur \nsomewhere between one in 1500 and one in 2000 births (ISNA, n.d.), \nbut there is at least some degree of genital ambiguity in about one in \n100 births (Thomas, 2005). Things are thus complicated by the fact \nthat there is little consensus about what constitutes a person who is \nintersex and what constitutes a person who is unproblematically female \nor unproblematically male (ISNA, n.d.).\n",

There is also room for disagreement about what it \nmeans to introduce intersex as a third sex category. For some, intersex \nconstitutes a natural kind category on a par with the two well-established \nsex categories, female and male. To illustrate, consider an analogy \nwith hair colour. Although dark- and fair-haired people are far more \ncommon than those with red hair worldwide, mainstream science does \nnot therefore regard red hair as a failed attempt by nature to produce \nhair of a more common colour. Although a similar perspective could be \napplied to the phenomenon of intersex, some instead regard intersex as \nan unfortunate aberration. Again, consider an analogy with hair colour. \nWhere red hair is included in the range of what mainstream science \nregards as normal, the lack of pigmentation characteristic of albinism is \nnot. Instead, it is attributed to an intrusion upon the processes through \nwhich the body normally produces melanin, just as intersex is sometimes \nattributed to an interruption or disruption in the processes that normally \nproduce the more familiar alignment of unambiguous genital, gonadal, \nhormonal, and chromosomal structures. While the accepted paradigm \nprecludes speculation regarding the hair colour a redhead ‘should have \nhad’ or ‘would have had’, it invites such speculation regarding people \nwith albinism.\nDepending on the paradigm, otherwise healthy intersex people are \nregarded either as imperfect specimens of one of the two well-established \nsex categories, or as unproblematic members of some alternative sex \ncategory. Scientists have not reached consensus about which paradigm to \napply to the phenomenon of intersex. Even those who agree that human \nsex differentiation is not limited to the categories of female and male do \nnot always agree about the number of natural kinds into which human \nsex divides. Ann Fausto-Sterling (1993), for example, makes a compelling \ncase for organizing the biological concept of sex into, not two or three, but \na minimum of five distinct categories. As demonstrated by Alice Domurat \nDreger (1998b), ideas about the status of alternative sex categories have \nundergone some significant changes throughout recent history:\nThe literature on hermaphroditism also reveals, however, that \nthere was not a single, unified medical opinion about which traits \nshould count as essentially or significantly feminine or masculine. \nIn France and Britain, the sexes were constructed in many different, \nsometimes conflicting ways in hermaphrodite theory and medical \npractice, as medical men struggled to come up with a system of \nsex difference that would hold.

Sex itself was still open to doubt. \n(Dreger, 1998b, p.16)\nAlthough there is a movement underway in North America to promote \nawareness about and acceptance of intersex identities, the medical \nprofession remains committed to the use of surgical and hormonal \nintervention in intersex patients:\nScientific dogma has held fast to the assumption that without \nmedical care hermaphrodites are doomed to a life of misery. Yet \nthere are few empirical studies to back up that assumption, and \nsome of the same research gathered to build a case for medical \ntreatment contradicts it. \n(Fausto-Sterling, 1993, p.23)\nThere is often a great deal of shame surrounding intersex identity and \nsecrecy surrounding surgical and hormonal interventions performed by \nthe medical profession. Children who are born intersex often discover \nthis only after they are adults, and often only by accident. Some \nintersex adults lament the loss of the bodies and identities they might \nhave developed had they not been subjected to medical intervention \n(Ward, 2000). As a result of this intervention, they no longer have the \nbodies they were born with, nor, however, do they have bodies that are \nunproblematically female or male.\nFor a particularly poignant example of the arrogance with which the \nmedical profession has been known to impose itself on the sexed body \nin the interest of regulation, consider the well-known case of Bruce, aka \nBrenda, aka David Reimer.2 Bruce Reimer, who was identified at birth \nas biologically male, was surgically reassigned as female following a \nbotched circumcision. Bruce was renamed Brenda and raised as a girl. \nBruce’s identical twin brother, Brian, suffered no complications and was \nraised as a boy. Because the two children were identical twins, this case \nwas regarded by many as an opportunity to empirically test the theory \nthat the distinction between women and men is primarily attributable \nto socialization. Initially, Brenda’s reassignment was believed to be \nso successful that the ‘twins case’ was cited in many women’s studies \ntextbooks as evidence of gender socialization.3 Apparently, however, \nBrenda never felt completely comfortable as a girl and eventually resumed \na male identity, this time under the name David Reimer. Sadly, Reimer \nnever found peace and finally committed suicide in 2004.\nIn an article for Ms. Magazine, ‘Making the Cut’, Martha Coventry \n(2000) outlines the recent history of the medical manipulation of bodies \n",

The story begins in Victorian England \nwith the theory, attributed to a medical doctor by the name of Isaac \nBaker Brown, that clitoral stimulation was the source of a variety of \nhealth problems in women. Extreme cases of conditions ranging from \nepilepsy to the amorphous diagnosis of hysteria, were treated with \nclitoridectomy. By the middle of the 20th century, there was a fairly \nwidespread recognition that clitoridectomy was ineffective both at \npreventing female masturbation and at treating the various conditions \nto which female masturbation had been linked. The procedure was not, \ntherefore, abandoned. Instead, it was simply redirected toward cosmetic \nends. The new theory, attributed to a doctor by the name of John Money, \nis that an enlarged clitoris can be trimmed, and thereby normalized, for \nimproved quality of life.\nIn a sidebar titled ‘The Unabridged Version’, Coventry relates a story \nthat reveals the oversized clitoris to be a potential source of pleasure:\nSome girls born with big clitorises are not surgically altered. Perhaps \nno one notices their clitoris at birth, or maybe they are born at \nhome away from medical intervention. Kim is a petite 26-year-old \nwhose clitoris is large enough when erect to penetrate her women \nlovers. She has never had any shame about it. ‘I really didn’t have a \nproblem with it. I mean, people didn’t go around looking between \nmy legs. It wasn’t something I had to hide, because no one looked \nat it. I was much more concerned about other things, like my thighs \nbeing fat.’ She remembers that growing up ‘anything I rubbed on \nwas very sexual to me. My clitoris was big enough to have a very \nsatisfying experience; most of it was outside my labia.’ But Kim, \na mother with a child of her own, still worries about what the \nmedical establishment could do to her. She jokes only half-heartedly \nof getting a medical ID bracelet that reads, ‘In case of accident, DO \nNOT remove clitoris’. \n(Coventry, 2000, p.58)\nDespite what medical practitioners think about the potential quality of \nlife for a woman with a large clitoris, Kim’s story is a compelling case \nin favour of allowing those born with ambiguous but otherwise healthy \ngenitals to wait until puberty or adulthood to make their own informed \ndecisions about whether to pursue surgery.

Because biology seeks to \nexplain, among other things, such processes as mating and reproduction, \nbiological definitions of sex categories typically make reference to \nsexuality, while biological definitions of sexual activity, in turn, make \nreference to sex categories. The fact that the same word, ‘sex’, is used \nin reference both to sex categories and to sexual activity reveals an \nunderlying assumption that sex, in terms of sexual activity, derives \ndirectly from the division into sex categories and that sex, in terms of \nsex categories, leads directly to sexual activity. In the strictly biological \nsense, sex categories and sex acts are intimately connected, and both are \nultimately concerned with reproduction. In practice, however, neither \nsex categories nor sex acts involve reproduction much of the time. The \nexperience of living as a woman or a man often has little, if anything, \nto do with the production of offspring. Likewise, the experience of \nparticipating in sex acts often has very little, if anything, to do with the \nproduction of offspring. Even the intimacy that occurs between those \ninvolved in monogamous pair bonds that carry the potential to produce \nchildren is not always directed toward the end goal of reproduction. \nNevertheless, there seems to be an implicit assumption by many people \nthat there is an invisible but essential link between sex categories, sex \nacts, and reproduction. But just as there are some people who do not fit \neasily into either of the binary sex categories, there are also people who \nbreak the expected continuity between membership in one sex category \nand sexual desire that is oriented toward members of the contrasting sex \ncategory for reproductive ends. Consider, for example, biological women \nwho are drawn toward sexuality with other biological women, and \nbiological men who are drawn toward sexuality with other biological \nmen, such that reproduction as a direct consequence of the sex acts they \nperform together is simply not possible. Also consider those for whom \nthe sex category of others is irrelevant in determining sexual desire, such \nthat reproduction is possible, but not a necessary consequence of the sex \nacts in which they participate. Consider those for whom sexual desire is \ndevoid of any procreative drive, such that reproduction is an unwanted \npotential consequence of some sex acts, but not its purpose. Consider the \nmany reasons for which the alleged connection between sex, sexuality, \nand reproduction is absent for most people at most times.\nSex is sufficiently complex to defy easy definition. Indeed, just what to \ninclude as examples of sex acts is open to debate and often depends on \ncontext. The boundaries of sexual desire and sexual behaviour are often \nunclear, and there is no single, authoritative set of necessary and sufficient \nconditions by which sex acts are defined. What constitutes a sex act in \none context may be decidedly non-sexual in a different context. This is \n",

It is also evident in the difference between \nactivities that people do not usually regard as erotic, and those same \nactivities when performed by people for whom they have taken on erotic \nsignificance. Virtually any ordinary activity could, at least in principle, \nbe rendered erotic under the right circumstances, and virtually any erotic \nactivity could, in principle, be rendered ordinary. Is it properly regarded as \na sex act when someone wears leather, rubber, silk, lace, fishnet stockings, \nstiletto heels, work boots, a maid’s uniform, a school uniform, an animal \ncostume, or any other garment around which a fetish might be formed? \nIs it properly regarded as a sex act when someone steps in ground meat? \nDoes the answer depend on whether this is done to satisfy the sexual urges \nof oneself or a partner? Does masturbation constitute a sex act? Does the \nanswer depend on whether another person is present? That there seems to \nbe no end to such questions casts doubt on the possibility of articulating \nan exhaustive and exclusive list of necessary and sufficient conditions for \ndistinguishing between sex acts and other sorts of acts. \nSex lacks boundaries in that there is a seemingly limitless array of \npotential sex acts. For at least some people, sex lacks boundaries in \nanother way as well. While sexual pleasure, particularly the sexual \npleasure of men, is often characterized in terms of the single, discrete \nmoment of ejaculation, some people, particularly some women, describe \nsexual pleasure as a more continuous experience. According to Luce \nIrigaray, for example, a woman’s sexual pleasure is not confined to a \nsingle body part, but rather ‘the geography of her pleasure is far more \ndiversified, more multiple in its differences, more complex, more subtle, \nthan is commonly imagined’ (Irigaray, 1985, p.28). Irigaray explains the \nimpact of this ‘geography’ of women’s pleasure:\nThus what they desire is precisely nothing, and at the same time \neverything. Always something more and something else besides \nthat one – sexual organ, for example – that you give them, attribute \nto them. Their desire is often interpreted, and feared, as a sort of \ninsatiable hunger, a voracity that will swallow you whole. Whereas \nit really involves a different economy more than anything else, one \nthat upsets the linearity of a project, undermines the goal-object \nof a desire, diffuses the polarization toward a single pleasure, \ndisconcerts fidelity to a single discourse…\n(Irigaray, 1985, pp.29–30) [ellipses in original] \nIn the final analysis, biology alone is insufficient to divide the human \npopulation into women and men, and it is likewise insufficient to \nestablish our pleasures and desires. The unique sexuality of any person \nin particular is not a straightforward consequence of membership in a \ngiven sex category. This does not mean, however, that sex and sexuality \n",

Perhaps this is \nbest explained by extending the earlier analogy with hair colour a bit \nfurther. Hair colour, like sex, is something that is usually thought of as a \nbiological condition. In addition, hair colour, like sex, is often simplified \ninto two categories. Hair can be divided into just light or blond shades \nand dark or brunette shades, despite the recognition that there is variation \nwithin these two categories, as in the case of hair that is platinum blond, \ndirty blond, chestnut, raven, etc., and in the case of hair that does not \nfall into either of the two dominant categories, as in the case of hair \nthat is copper, auburn, etc. Hair colour is unlike sex, however, in that \npeople are usually comfortable with a lack of certainty about adult hair \ncolour at the time of birth. Bald infants usually grow hair, light-haired \nchildren often become dark-haired adults, and people accept that hair \ncolour can change even during adult life, as through greying or whitening \nof the hair. In other words, although hair colour is understood to be a \nbiological trait, it is not thereby regarded as stable throughout life. In \naddition, cosmetic intervention enables people to change their hair colour \nwith relative ease. Such intervention sometimes invites questions about \nauthenticity, as expressed through questions along the lines of, ‘Is that \na natural blond?’. Even so, cosmetic intervention with regard to hair \ncolour is more commonly understood as a matter of aesthetic preference \nor creative expression. Those who favour ‘letting nature run its course’ \nand ‘aging gracefully’ tend not to devote much effort to preventing others \nfrom making cosmetic changes – and when they do, it is generally for \nreasons other than a belief in the primary importance of hair colour: for \nexample, some feminists might be inclined to discourage women from \nattempting to conform to a culturally accepted standard of beauty that \ndisplays a preference for youthful blonds.\nThus, the mere fact that sex is biological does not establish that sex \nis fixed at birth or stable throughout life. It is entirely possible that, just \nas hair colour sometimes undergoes both voluntary and involuntary \nchanges throughout a person’s life, so too does sex. Both the sex category \nto which a person belongs and the sex acts in which a person is likely \nto participate can undergo changes throughout life. Although it seems \nobvious that even very young children are sexual beings, how they enact \ntheir sexuality is presumably quite different than it will be when they are \nolder. The fact that sex is biological is likewise insufficient to establish \nthat sex is always beyond the realm of personal choice. Just as hair \ncolour can undergo elective changes throughout life, so can the various \nfeatures associated with sex category membership. The purpose of this \nanalogy is not to suggest that people are as whimsical about changing \nsex category as they often are about changing hair colour. Instead, it is \nsimply to acknowledge that biological features can and often do change \nover the course of the human lifespan.4\n",

The concert was so successful that it became an \nannual event, now known as the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival,1 \nor less formally, ‘Michfest’ or even just ‘Michigan’, and abbreviated \nthroughout as MWMF. As indicated in a promotional flyer from 1978, \nthe festival was conceived as ‘A Gathering of Mothers and Daughters \nfor Womyn-Born Womyn’ (Vogel, 2000). According to Linda Vogel, \n‘The hallmark of Michigan has always been its creation of separate, \nself-defined and deeply honored womyn’s space’ (Vogel, 2000). The \nfestival grounds, often referred to simply as ‘the land’, are designated \nexclusively for women, which reflects a commitment to the separatist \nagenda associated with some versions of radical feminism.\nBriefly, radical feminism is characterized by a critique of patriarchal \noppression, often coupled with the belief that patriarchal oppression \nis inevitable in virtually any social context that puts women and men \ntogether.2 According to a 1975 document issued by Oven Productions, \nwomen-only concert venues provide a welcome alternative to the \nubiquitous sexism of the larger US culture:\nBecause of women’s past experiences in a sexist society, men \n(regardless of their politics, consciousness and good intentions) \nnegatively alter the dynamic of a woman-space.

In fact, \nthey do not want to put themselves in the situation of representing \nthe oppressor at a women’s event. \n(Oven Productions, 1975) [ellipses in original] \nThe document also suggests that those who demand a defence of women-\nonly spaces ultimately, though perhaps inadvertently, drain energy from \nthe women who seek them:\nIt is also important that men not drain women of energy by constantly \ndemanding explanation after explanation. The government keeps \nactivists tied up in trials (their money, their energy, their friends) \nin order to keep them from continuing their important work. Men \noften do this to women.

There are biologically unambiguous females who \nnevertheless identify as men, and vice-versa. That such discrepancies \nare even possible reveals a gap between biological definitions of sex and \nthe broader definitions of what it means to be a woman or a man. The \nconcept of gender is used in reference to the various connotations and \nexpectations that are associated with biological sex but are not contained \nwithin the biological definitions.4 More recently, however, many people \nhave begun using gender almost interchangeably with sex. For some \npeople, this shift reflects an understanding of the ways in which biological \nsex is itself complicated, as well, perhaps, as a desire to be inclusive of \nthose for whom there is a significant incongruity between the sex of \nthe body and the internal experience of feminine or masculine identity. \nIndeed, the term transgender has largely replaced the term transsexual in \n",

Whether we’re \nharassed because we ‘don’t look like women’ or we ‘look like \nwe’re asking for it,’ it’s all a part of the same sexist, gender-rigid, \npatriarchal system that we are trying to resist.\n(Lamm et al., 2001)\nIn the words of Riki Wilchins, as quoted in a 1999 press release by Clare \nHowell, ‘Discrimination against any woman must always be contested’ \n(Howell, 1999). \nNot all feminists, and not all MWMF attendees, would agree with \nthis assessment, however. In what is perhaps the most blatant example of \ntransphobia within feminist discourse, Janice Raymond’s The Transsexual \nEmpire, first published in 1979, compares the surgical pursuit of female \ngenitalia by trans women to an act of rape. According to Raymond, rape \nis best defined as a violation of the integrity of a woman’s body, and \n‘transsexuals rape women’s bodies by reducing the real female form to \nan artifact, appropriating this body for themselves’ (Raymond, 2006, \np.134). Predictably, Raymond is quick to extend the rape metaphor to \nthe example of trans women who identify as lesbian-feminists. Raymond \nbelieves that a trans woman who identifies as a lesbian-feminist ‘feeds off \nwoman’s true energy source, i.e., her woman-identified self’. Of the lesbian-\nfeminist trans woman, Raymond claims, ‘It is he [sic] who recognizes \nthat if female spirit, mind, creativity, and sexuality exist anywhere in \na powerful way, it is here, among lesbian-feminists’ (Raymond, 2006, \np.136). Raymond’s version of radical feminism advances a biologically \ndeterministic definition of what it means to be a woman, and then rejects \ntrans women for failing to embody this definition.\nNot all feminists accept the essentialism associated with radical \nfeminism. In fact, some who are strongly opposed to biological essentialism \naccuse trans people of reinforcing the binary system of sex and gender. \nConsider, for example, that while many trans activists advocated for the \ninclusion of gender identity disorder (GID) as a psychological disorder \nin the 1980 update of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders (DSM-III), many feminists repudiate GID for attempting to \nestablish meaningful distinctions between appropriate and inappropriate \nforms of gender expression. It is worth noting that although many trans \nactivists favour the continued use of GID as a medical diagnosis, the \nmany who do not are working diligently in an effort to have it removed \nfrom the next updated edition of the DSM. Additionally, trans people \nwho favour the continued inclusion of GID in the DSM often do so \nfor pragmatic reasons, such as easier access to prescribed treatments, \nprimarily hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery. Feminists who \ndo not identify as trans are often slow to recognize the significance of such \npractical considerations, and comparatively quick to express objections \nbased on principle.

For example, Sheila \nJeffreys refers to sex reassignment as a ‘mutilating surgery’ (2003, p.1) \nand regards the practice of packing9 as evidence that ‘the worship of \nmasculinity had triumphed over the lesbian feminist project of ending \ngender hierarchy’ (2003, p.1). As Judith Halberstam10 notes, ‘Some \nlesbians seem to see FTMs as traitors to a “women’s” movement who \ncross over and become the enemy’ (Halberstam, 1998, p.287).\nHalberstam describes an ongoing border war over the boundary \nbetween butch and trans identities, suggesting that ‘lesbians have tended \nto erase FTMs by claiming transsexual males as lesbians who lack access \nto a liberating lesbian discourse’ (Halberstam, 1998, p.293). An example \nof this tendency can be found among those who characterize Billy \nTipton, not as a trans man, but rather as a lesbian trapped in a social and \nprofessional world in which there was no room for lesbian women:\nSo, for example, Billy Tipton, the jazz musician who lived his life \nas a man and who married a woman, is often represented within \nlesbian history as a lesbian woman forced to hide her gender in \norder to advance within her profession, rather than as a transsexual \nman living within his chosen gender identity. \n(Halberstam, 1998, p.293)\n\t\nIn another example of the tendency to claim lesbian status for those \nwho might just as easily be identified as trans men, Leslie Feinberg’s \nnovel Stone Butch Blues is usually characterized as a lesbian novel, even \nthough it makes just as much sense to interpret the protagonist, Jess, as a \ntrans man. This also occurs in connection with Radcliffe Hall’s The Well \nof Loneliness. Like Feinberg’s Jess, Hall’s Stephen has always felt more \nlike a boy than a girl, and eventually comes to present publicly as a man \nin at least some contexts. Even so, The Well of Loneliness, like Stone \nButch Blues, is usually described not as a novel about trans identity but \nrather as a novel about lesbian identity.\nHalberstam does not simply suggest that these examples be \nreinterpreted as examples of trans identities. Instead, Halberstam \nquestions the usefulness of attempting to demarcate between butch and \ntrans masculinities. Halberstam also questions the usefulness of the \n",

Biddy Martin identifies a wide range of problems \nwith the notion of such a continuum:\nWhile the political purpose of such a continuum seems clear \nand compelling, namely, to challenge the stigma attached to \ntranssexualism, and while it is true that butch lesbians have been \nassociated historically with gender dysphoria or dysfunction, I \nwould suggest that making gender dysphoria or gender dysfunction \ntoo central to butchness constructs butchness in negativity, curiously \nmakes anatomy the ground of identity, and suggests that femmes, \nby contrast to butches, are at least implicitly gender-conformist. \nIt also seems problematic to put gender identities, sexual object \nchoice, gender dysphoria, transgenderism, and transsexualism \non a continuum. In keeping with the effort to separate gender \nand sexuality in order to expose their complex imbrications and \nconfigurations with one another, it seems productive as well to \nconsider that the categories of experience listed above are also \ndiscrete, and that our compulsion to create coherence or political \nsolidarities suppresses the disjunctions. \n(Martin, 1994, p.117)\nLike Halberstam, C. Jacob Hale addresses the border war over the \nboundary between butch and trans identities. Hale describes the manner \nin which the murdered body of Brandon Teena, aka Teena Brandon, has \nserved as one of the battlefields upon which much of this border war has \nbeen fought. In a well known case popularized by Hilary Swank’s stellar \nportrayal in the film Boys Don’t Cry (Peirce, 1999), Brandon Teena was \ndesignated as female at birth and raised as a girl, but eventually began \nto enact a sufficiently masculine gender identity to be presumed male by \nmost people. When this secret was discovered, however, Brandon Teena \nwas raped and then murdered, presumably as punishment for violating \ncultural norms associated with gender, sex, and sexuality.\nAs Hale notes, attempts to classify Brandon Teena as butch rather \nthan trans or as trans rather than butch are problematic, not merely \nbecause Brandon Teena is no longer available to comment on the internal \nexperience of any alleged butch or trans subjectivity, but also because \nthe assumption that butch and trans identities are separated by a precise \nboundary is itself flawed:\nWhen the border wars are virophagic, eating the flesh of the living, \nwe might better be able to access relevant information about the lives \nof those whom we would place on the butch or the ftm side of the \n",

Even if we have such information and can be confident that \nit is reliable, there are still serious problems with definitions here. \nThe most likely clusters of characteristics to invoke definitionally \nare those of masculine subjectivity and the accessing of medically \nregulated technologies for male reembodiment. \n(Hale, 1998, p.321)\nHale goes on to explore the use of these features – namely the experience \nof masculine subjectivity and the medical pursuit of masculine \nembodiment – to differentiate between butch and trans. Hale notes, first, \nthat both butch women and trans men experience masculine subjectivity \nand, second, that not all trans men pursue or intend to pursue medical \nintervention.\nThings are not any clearer with regard to trans women than they are \nwith trans men. Not all feminine men identify as trans women, nor do \nall who identify as trans women pursue surgery or use hormones. There \nis also the additional phenomenon of drag, which further complicates \nthe distinction between both butch women and trans men, as well as \nthe distinction between feminine men and trans women. Drag involves \nthe temporary participation, usually as part of a stage performance, in \na highly exaggerated expression of a gender category which is often but \nnot always different from the gender category one normally occupies. \nCross-dressing involves wearing clothing and accessories associated with \na gender category one does not normally occupy, sometimes in connection \nwith sexual arousal or satisfaction. Although drag and cross-dressing are \noften conceptualized as existing somewhere along a continuum between \nconventional identities and trans identities, some drag performers and \nsome cross-dressers conform to cultural expectations about gender, sex, \nand sexuality in virtually every other way. In other words, some drag \nperformers and some cross-dressers enact their day-to-day identities as \nwomen and men in ways that are utterly unremarkable.\nAll of this supports Halberstam’s twofold suggestion, first, that the \nboundary separating butch women and trans men is subject to ongoing \nnegotiation and, second, that there is not even a continuum that draws \na straight line from butch to trans. Instead, it seems that the various \nidentity categories that are generally believed to be at least loosely related \nto trans identities are socially constructed and constantly negotiated.\nQueer Theory\nSandy Stone offers a way of thinking about women and men, particularly \ntrans women and trans men, that queers the existing binary:\n",

It is not immediately obvious, however, \njust how the essentialism that seems to underlie trans identity can be \nrendered consistent with the anti-essentialism often associated with \nqueer theory.\nAs a critic of both queer theory and trans identity, Sheila Jeffreys \nsuggests that those who simultaneously subscribe to queer theory and \nrecognize even the abstract possibility of trans identities, let alone those \nwho come out as trans or who advocate on behalf of trans people, thereby \nbetray an internal conflict:\nUnless we accept that there is such a thing as a real and essential \ntranssexualism, a notion which should be antithetical to queer \ntheory’s supposed anti-essentialism, then the inclusion of this \ncategory within queer politics does seem extraordinary. It defies the \nproud pro-lesbian and gay politics that are required in a liberation \nmovement by celebrating the castration of those who love the same \nsex. The inclusion of transsexuals also supports the notion that \ngender is essential, and the most retrograde notions of gender at \nthat. \n(Jeffreys, 2003, p.49)\nJeffreys’ concern over the essentialism that allegedly underlies trans \nidentities seems misplaced, given that Jeffreys subscribes to gender \nstereotypes that are especially insidious and irredeemably essentialist. \nAccording to Jeffreys, for example, gay men are promiscuous because \nthey have missed out on the training in temperance and sexual restraint \nthat heterosexual men receive through their relationships with women, \npresumably because women are inherently more modest about sex than \nmen are (Jeffreys, 2003, pp.72–3). Although Jeffreys’ own position is \neasily dismissed as mere stereotyping, this observation does not itself \nanswer the question about the apparent conflict between queer theory \nand the alleged essentialism of trans identities.\nIn response to Jeffreys, it is possible to respect, even to celebrate, \ntrans identities without thereby suggesting that the importance some \ntrans people place on bodily manifestations of feminine or masculine \nsubjectivities matters equally to all people – even to all trans people. \n",

It is \nimportant to recognize that trusting people to determine for themselves \nwhich identity categories feel the most authentic or natural is a simple \nmatter of respecting their human dignity and rightful autonomy. This does \nnot in any way preclude the celebration of what is sometimes referred to \nas cisgender identity, namely the gender normative identities of those \nwho exist unproblematically as women or men.11 Nor does it preclude \nthe simultaneous celebration of genderqueer identities that expose the \n‘mismatches between sex, gender and sexual desire’ (Jagose, 1996, p.3) \nfor those who are unwilling or unable to define themselves in terms of \nthe established binary. \nIn this context, rejecting essentialism means accepting that ‘women’ \nand ‘men’ are categories that have been and continue to be affected by \nsocial processes. This acceptance serves as an invitation to construct \nalternative categories. The construction of alternative categories, however, \nneed not entail the wholesale rejection of the existing categories. One \nway to challenge a binary is to deny or ignore the distinction it draws, \nfor example, by denying or ignoring the distinction between women and \nmen. This approach, which Jeffreys seems to regard as the only approach \npossible, ignores the significance that the distinction between women \nand men holds for many people, including many trans people. A more \ninviting way to challenge the existing binary is to construct additional \nalternatives, so that instead of just two categories there are many. By \nchallenging the binary in this manner, queer theory is capable of resisting \nessentialism while simultaneously affirming the experiences of people for \nwhom the established categories are problematic as well as people for \nwhom the established categories are relatively unproblematic.\nAdditional Resources \nCvetkovich, A. and Wahng, S.

In other words, butch women (or simply, butches) do not identify as \ntransgender. Butch identity is sometimes contrasted with the traditionally \nfeminine style of femme women (or simply, femmes). \n9\t In this context, packing refers to the practice among some trans men, and even \nsome butch women, of wearing a dildo or other prosthetic under the clothing \nin order to approximate the bodily presence of a penis.\n10\tAlthough the works cited here were published as Judith, Halberstam has \nrecently begun self-identifying as Judith/Jack Halberstam, Judith ‘Jack’ \nHalberstam, or soemtimes just ‘Jack’ Halberstam. \n11\tThe term cisgender was introduced as a way to refer to those who are not \ntransgender without resorting to words like ‘biological’ or ‘regular’, which \ninevitably imply that the gender expression of people who do not identify \nas transgender is more authentic than or otherwise preferable to the gender \nexpression of people who do identify as transgender. According to some people, \nhowever, cisgender is a problematic, perhaps even self-defeating, term because \nit can be interpreted as suggesting that those who identify as lesbian, gay, or \nbisexual, for example, but not as transgender, experience no mismatch between \ntheir own gender identity and gender expression and cultural expectations \nregarding gender identity and expression.\n",

For example, \npeople from the same home town often share a kindred bond in virtue of \ntheir common experience, and a similar bond can be found among those \nwho appreciate the same art, music, sport, or hobby. It should come as \nno surprise, then, that the distinction between boys and girls in early \nchildhood sometimes leads, in older children and adults, to a sense of \nsolidarity among those who identify as ‘real’ men or ‘real’ women – and \nan attempt to assimilate by many who do not.\nAlthough Beauvoir seemed critical of this tendency, especially when \nmanifested in the form of sexism, a commitment to what could be described \nas the inevitability of alterity does not invite optimism about avoiding the \ninequalities that often result from the distinction between insiders and \noutsiders; between ‘us’ and ‘them’. Beauvoir was not alone in suggesting \nthat the tendency to make such distinctions is characteristic of the human \ncondition. Many, particularly those who are reluctant to disrupt existing \nhierarchies, use this point to defend their resistance to social change. \nConsider, for instance, those who reject feminism on the assumption \nthat it favours women over men, or those who oppose affirmative action \nprogrammes on the assumption that they favour minority groups over \nthe dominant group. Lurking beneath these assumptions is the notion \nthat established distinctions, such as those based on sex and race, are \nlasting divisions that would endure even major shifts in the existing \npower structure.1 According to this line of reasoning, as long as there are \ndifferences, for example, between male and female reproductive organs, \nwe will continue to divide ourselves in virtue of such differences.\nA more complicated version of Beauvoir’s point is present in the \nsuggestion that feminism, as a form of identity politics,2 will inevitably \nfail because the identity categories, such as sex and gender, that promise to \nunite a group of people are always mitigated by additional categories that \nultimately divide the members of that group. On this view, the differences \nthat separate women from men are insufficient to unify women against \nsexism given the additional differences that separate women on the basis \nof racial identity, ethnic identity, class identity, sexual identity, and so on. \nThis carries Beauvoir’s reasoning to its logical extreme, suggesting that \nafter separating themselves from passengers in the other compartments, the \ntravellers would soon subdivide into those on the left side of the train and \nthose on the right, those by the window and those by the aisle, until none \nof them could experience solidarity with any other. Although there does \nseem to be a tendency for people to differentiate between ‘us’ and ‘them’, \nit does not necessarily follow that oppression is an inherent or necessary \nfunction of identifying someone or something as different, or ‘other’. \nBeauvoir would likely agree that there is a qualitative difference between \nthe distinction drawn between ‘us’ and ‘them’ by people who happen to be \ntravelling together and the distinction between ‘us’ and ‘them’ drawn on \nthe basis of such presumably fixed categories as sex or race.\n",

The process of becoming a woman is \nintimately intertwined with the process by which someone is identified as \nor differentiated from a man. The male self is asserted as the subject, or \nthe ‘One’ only by identifying the female as the object, or the ‘Other.’ As \nMarilyn Frye explains:\nSo he conjures an object that is object but not also subject, which he \ncan oppose but which will not oppose him – which does not require \na reciprocal relation. Not a ‘relative’ other (who is also subject and \ndemands reciprocity), but an ‘absolute’ Other. This subject is male/\nmasculine, which Beauvoir both acknowledges and accepts when \nshe says that woman is the Other – the ‘absolute Other’ posed by \nthe (male) subject. It is through posing the Other – woman – that \nthe subject constructs himself... as One and sovereign, secure and \nsafe. Becoming a woman is becoming an ‘absolute’ Other. One \ncannot be a woman and be a subject. \n(Frye, 1996, p.993)\nThis explanation of how people come to identify as women and men \nsuggests that these identity categories are contingent. To regard them \nas contingent is to acknowledge that they could have been, and perhaps \ncould yet be, other than they are. By recognizing that ‘no subset of \nhuman beings is destined by biology or a distinctive essence to being the \nabsolute Other’ (Frye, 1996, p.994), Beauvoir anticipated what would \neventually be identified as the sex-gender distinction. \nIn the 1970s, some feminist scholars began using ‘gender’, a term \nborrowed from linguistics, to distinguish socially learned differences \nbetween women and men from biologically innate differences.4 It seems \nobvious to many people that clothing styles and grooming habits are \nsocial, for example, while genital structures are biological.5 There is no \nclear consensus regarding some of the many characteristics associated \nwith the distinction between women and men, however. Whether there \nis a biological basis for the twofold characterization of men as more \naggressive than women and women as more nurturing than men is open \nto debate, even among feminists.6 The mere recognition that there is a \ndistinction between sex and gender does not reveal which differences \nare sex differences and which are gender differences. In other words, \nthe distinction between sex and gender does not itself determine which \nof the characteristics commonly associated with women belong to the \nfemale sex and which belong instead to the feminine gender, and it does \nnot determine which of the characteristics commonly associated with \n",

In a second and closely related usage, gender refers to the mind, \nwhile sex refers to the body. Used in this manner, gender refers to private \nmental experiences, such as the experience of feeling ‘like a woman’ or \nfeeling ‘like a man’ that can occur independent of biological sex. In a \nthird and potentially more problematic usage, gender is used virtually \ninterchangeably with sex in reference to any of the characteristics by \nwhich women and men can be differentiated.\nAnother source of confusion in connection with the distinction \nbetween sex and gender derives from the recognition that the physical \ncharacteristics, both of whole populations and of particular members, \nall have unique social histories. The boundary between that which is \nsocial and that which is biological is not nearly as crisp as implied by \nsome feminist discussions. Consider, for instance, that all of the different \ndog breeds in existence today are the deliberate result of an ongoing7 \nprocess of selective breeding,8 and yet they are also biologically distinct \nenough for individual dogs to be judged in shows as better or worse \nexamples of different breeds. That all dogs from poodles to pitbulls came \nabout through social processes does not mean that specific poodles and \npitbulls do not now exist in reality, nor does it mean that the differences \namong various instantiations of different breeds can be imagined away. \nThis example debunks the hasty assumption that social phenomena and \nbiological phenomena are mutually exclusive, and it demonstrates the \nvery real impact of social phenomena on physical bodies.\nIn another example of social processes impacting physical bodies, \nrecent research (Cochran and Harpending, 2009) indicates that the \nability to digest milk beyond infancy developed only within the past \n10,000 years, only in some cultures, and only in connection with the \ndomestication of certain livestock, including camels and cattle. One \nexplanation is that the ability to consume dairy products offered greater \nsurvival potential, particularly during times of famine, and those with a \ngenetic mutation that allowed for uninterrupted production of lactose, \nthe enzyme that digests milk sugar, had an evolutionary advantage. In \ncontemporary western parlance, the expression ‘lactose intolerance’ \nmarks the inability to process dairy products as an aberration. In fact, the \naberration occurred when various cultures stopped outgrowing the lactose \ntolerance necessary for nursing during infancy. In a related example, a \nwealth of empirical research (Lewis, 1975; Pande, 2003; Mishra, et al., \n2004; and Spruijt-Metz, et al., 2006) suggests that there are significant \ndisparities around the world in the treatment of female and male infants, \nincluding disparities in feeding and nutrition.

In addition to \ndemonstrating the wisdom that underlies the old adage, ‘You are what \nyou eat’, these examples also reveal that even biological characteristics \nreflect the environmental context in which they are situated. This does \nnot amount merely to the attractive but relatively trite notion that nature \nand nurture both shape human development, but rather to the somewhat \nmore subtle suggestion that bodies are themselves moulded by the social \nenvironment from which they emerge.\nGender-Neutral and Gender-Inclusive Language\nThe obscured boundary between nature and nurture notwithstanding, \nthe distinction between sex and gender is nevertheless a useful heuristic9 \nfor acknowledging the extent to which current ideas and ideals about \nwomen and men are culturally contingent. The distinction between \nsex and gender provides a conceptual framework for recognizing the \nexistence of some differences between women and men, including some \nbiological differences, without thereby assuming that all differences are \nbiological. It also issues an invitation to engage in a critical examination \nof various aspects of the social environment and to explore the possibility \nof changing that environment to avoid the perpetuation of existing \ngender roles. In a particularly poignant example of such exploration, \nMarge Piercy’s feminist science fiction classic, Woman on the Edge of \nTime, imagines a utopian society, Mattapoisett, that is free of gender \nsocialization and gender roles (Piercy, 1976). In the utopian future \nworld of Mattapoisett, the life histories and, as a result, the bodies of \nwomen and men are virtually indistinguishable. In Piercy’s Mattapoisett, \n‘person’ replaces the nominative case gender pronouns ‘she’ and ‘he’, \nwhile ‘per’ replaces the possessive and objective case pronouns ‘her’, \n‘his’, and ‘him.’\nDespite the allegedly neutral use of ‘man’, ‘he’, ‘his’, and ‘him’ to refer \nin the abstract to any generic person, these terms inevitably seem to grant \npriority to men and masculinity.10 Granting linguistic priority to any one \nsocial group sends a powerful message about who matters and who does \nnot. For this reason, people, both individually and collectively, struggled and \ncontinue to struggle to articulate better and worse ways of addressing the \nissue of gender in language. Consider, for example, the guidelines accepted \nin 1986 by the American Philosophical Association on the ‘nonsexist use \nof language’ within philosophy (Warren, 1986), the 1991 statement by the \nAmerican Psychological Association on avoiding ‘heterosexual bias’, or \nJacob Hale’s more recent articulation of a set of rules ‘for non-transsexuals \n",

This strategy enjoyed some limited \nand localized successes in the 1970s, and is preferred even today by some \npeople, including some transgender and intersex people, who do not fit \nstraightforwardly or unproblematically into exactly one gender category, \nfemale or male. Leslie Feinberg, for example, who was categorized as \nbiologically female upon birth, eventually developed a more masculine \nidentity, and now prefers to be referred to by the pronouns ‘ze’, ‘hir’, \nand ‘hirself’.11 Although these were initially intended as gender-neutral \nreplacement terms for ‘she’, ‘he’, ‘her’, ‘his’, and ‘him’, they are now used, \nif they are used at all, not instead of, but in addition to more familiar \ngender-specific pronouns. ‘She’ and ‘her’ are still used for those who are \nunquestionably female; ‘he’, ‘him’, and ‘his’ are still used for those who are \nunquestionably male; and ‘ze’ and ‘hir’ are rarely used, except in reference \nto those who resist binary classification.\nAlternative gender pronouns, like ‘ze’ and ‘hir’, can be used in addition \nto or instead of the more familiar gender pronouns, ‘she’, ‘he’, ‘her’, \n‘him’, and ‘his.’ This emphasizes an important difference between the \nuse of gender-neutral and gender-inclusive language. Language is neutral \nwhen a single term is used to refer equally to all of the different categories \nof people. Language is inclusive when multiple terms are used to refer \nseparately and specifically to more than one, and ideally to all, relevant \ncategories of people. Gender neutrality and gender inclusivity are two \ndifferent ways of addressing the symbolic priority that has been granted \nto men and masculinity in recent history. The wholesale replacement of \n‘he’ and ‘she’ with ‘ze’, and of ‘her’ and ‘his’ with ‘hir’, would mark a \ntransition from gender-specific language to gender-neutral language. The \naddition of ‘ze’ and ‘hir’ as third options in cases where ‘she’ and ‘he’ or \n‘her’ and ‘his’ do not fit, however, is a transition, not to gender-neutral \nlanguage, but rather to gender-inclusive, or at least more gender-inclusive \nlanguage. While the simultaneous use of both ‘he’ and ‘she’ acknowledges \na range of gender possibilities that is more inclusive than just ‘he’, the \nsimultaneous use of ‘he’, ‘she’, and ‘ze’ acknowledges a range of gender \npossibilities that is even more inclusive.\nDespite limited use by Leslie Feinberg and a few other noteworthy \nexamples, the attempted introduction of new gender pronouns was \nlargely unsuccessful. Even so, there have been some gradual and lasting \nchanges in response to feminist concerns about linguistic bias. Consider, \nfor example, the now familiar use of ‘he or she’, ‘he/she’, ‘(s)he’, or even \n‘they’12 to refer to a generic or hypothetical person. Compare this with \nthe recent past, when US schoolchildren were taught that it was necessary \nto use ‘he’ and ‘his’ when referring to a person in the abstract. Also \nconsider the fairly recent transition from using such gender-specific terms \nas ‘waiter’, ‘waitress’, ‘salesman’, ‘stewardess’, and the like, to using \n",

Consider, finally, the growing tendency to substitute ‘people’ or \n‘humankind’ for ‘man’ and ‘mankind’.\nIn some contexts, the implementation of gender-neutral language \nhas been more successful than the implementation of gender-inclusive \nlanguage, and in other contexts the implementation of gender-inclusive \nlanguage has been more successful. In many, perhaps even most, contexts \nrelated to employment, gender-neutral terminology currently prevails. In \nsome cases, this transition to gender-neutral language has been achieved \nthrough the elimination of terms that were once used to signal female \nor feminine identity, as in the growing tendency to replace ‘actress’ with \n‘actor’ in reference to both male and female performers. In other cases, new \nterminology has been introduced to replace gender-specific terminology \nof the past, as with the growing tendency to replace ‘mailman’, ‘fireman’, \nand the like with terms such as ‘letter carrier’, ‘firefighter’, and so forth. \nThrough the simple elimination of terms marked as feminine, and \nthrough the introduction of entirely new terms, many job titles have been \nrevised to avoid any reference to the sex or gender of the worker. Once \ncommonplace, it now seems vaguely offensive to draw attention to sex \nand gender with expressions such as ‘male nurse’ and ‘female cop’, which \nimply that it is unexpected and therefore worthy of comment for a man \nto become a nurse or for a woman to become a police officer.\nIn other contexts, however, the trend seems to favour gender-inclusive \nterminology over gender-neutral terminology. One example is the \nwidespread use of both ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’, rather than just ‘gay’, to refer \nto women and men whose primary erotic orientation is towards members \nof the same sex. Just as ‘man’ can be used generically to refer to women \nand men, ‘gay’ can also be used generically to refer to women and men \nwho identify as homosexual. But just as the gender-specific meaning of \n‘man’ can interfere with its intended gender-neutral meaning, the gender-\nspecific meaning of ‘gay’ can also interfere with its intended gender-\nneutral meaning. Even if they mean to refer to women and men alike, \nstatements like, ‘The man selected for the new management position will \nreceive a substantial raise in pay’, or ‘Any employee who would like to \nbe considered for promotion must submit his resumé by Friday’, may \ninadvertently imply that women will not be given serious consideration. \nSimilarly, a statement such as ‘We are committed to addressing a range \nof gay issues’ carries the subtle suggestion that the primary concern will \nbe issues that confront gay men, and not necessarily those that confront \nlesbian women. Even ostensibly neutral terms, like ‘person’ instead of \n‘man’, or ‘homosexual’ instead of ‘gay’, may be insufficient to signal \nthe intent to include women. If all previous management positions have \nbeen filled by men, simply switching from ‘man’ to ‘person’ will not \nnecessarily convey the intention to give equal consideration to women \nthis time around.\n",

By making direct and explicit \nreference to women, gender-inclusive language also implies that there \nare relevant and significant differences between women and men in the \ngiven context. Reference not just to gay issues, but to gay and lesbian \nissues, implies that what matters most to lesbian women may be of less \ninterest to gay men, and vice versa. In the context of health care, for \nexample, lesbian women as a group may have more interest in breast \ncancer prevention and treatment, while gay men as a group may have \nmore interest in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Gender-neutral \nterms refer interchangeably to members of all sex and gender categories, \nthereby suggesting that women, men, and everyone else, are semantically \nequivalent. In some cases, then, the transition from neutral terms, like \n‘one’ and ‘people’, to more inclusive terms, like ‘he or she’ and ‘women \nand men’, constitutes a rejection of the assumption that women and men \nare fundamentally the same.\nUnlike gender-neutral language, gender-inclusive language specifies \nall categories intended for recognition. Because it specifies all categories \nintended for recognition, however, allegedly inclusive language inevitably \nexcludes those to whom no direct reference is made. References to both \nwomen and men may be more inclusive than references just to men but, \nunlike references to people in general, references to women and men \ninadvertently exclude people to whom the binary categories of sex and \ngender do not readily apply, notably transgender and intersex people. By \nthe same token, references to both lesbian women and gay men may be \nmore inclusive than references to just gay men but, unlike references to \npeople in general, references to lesbian women and gay men once again \nexclude people to whom the binary categories of sexuality do not readily \napply, notably those who identify as bisexual, polyamorous, asexual, or \notherwise outside the dichotomy between homosexual and heterosexual \norientation.\nThe distinction between inclusivity and neutrality in connection with \nthe discourse surrounding gender, sex, and sexuality also has a counterpart \nin connection with the discourse surrounding race and ethnicity. Just as \nallegedly neutral terms like ‘people’ and ‘humankind’ have been, and \noften are still, associated with members of the dominant categories \nof gender, sex, and sexuality, they also have been, and often are still, \nassociated with members of the dominant racial and ethnic categories. \nIn principle, gender-neutral terms, such as ‘person’ or ‘people’ refer \nequally and literally to all people, including transgender and intersex \npeople. In practice, unfortunately, the priority in contemporary US and \nEuropean culture granted to men (Moulton, 1977), more specifically \nto heterosexual men, and even more specifically to white, European or \nnorth-American, formally educated, upper-middle class, able-bodied, \nChristian, heterosexual men, is so deeply entrenched that what comes to \n",

What interferes with neutrality is the priority \nimplicitly granted to members of historically privileged categories, such \nas heterosexual men. What interferes with inclusivity is the priority \nexplicitly granted to members of the categories targeted for inclusion, \nsuch as women and men, or even lesbian women and gay men. Allegedly \ngender-inclusive language ultimately reinforces a familiar division of the \nhuman world into two basic categories. Whether the division is between \nfemale and male, feminine and masculine, women and men, lesbian \nwomen and gay men, or whatever, is largely irrelevant. It is irrelevant \nbecause the binary system of gender, sex, and sexuality is not just an \nunrelated set of categories, some involving biological sex and others \ninvolving learned behaviours and social or sexual roles. Rather, it is a \nholistic framework that regards gender, sex, and sexuality as expressions \nof a basic division of the human world into two distinct natural kinds.\nThe traditional doctrine of natural kinds reflects an underlying \ncommitment to essentialism about the natural world.14 According to John \nDupré (1993), there are three conditions that must be met according to \nessentialist versions of the doctrine of natural kinds: first, natural kind \ncategories should be clearly and unambiguously delineated. Second, \nnatural kind categories should be a product of discovery rather than \ninvention or creation. Third, natural kind categories should reveal as \nmuch information as possible about the members of those categories – \nand, ideally, they will reveal all of the essential characteristics of those \nmembers (Dupré, 1993, pp.17–18). The traditional, essentialist, doctrine \nof natural kinds depicts an orderly world that divides into thoroughly \ninformative categories inclusive of all phenomena without leftovers or \ncrossovers.15\nHilary Kornblith represents natural kinds as ‘homeostatic property \nclusters’ in which underlying structures produce the observable \nproperties that are distinctive of various natural kinds (Kornblith, \n1993). Kornblith suggests that experience reveals which properties and \nwhich sorts of properties are indicative of relevant underlying structural \ndifferences. Although Kornblith does not make direct reference to the \nproperties associated with gender, sex, and sexuality, these properties \nare commonly believed to form clusters around the two natural kinds \ninto which the human world divides.

For this reason, people who are not in full possession of \nthese features are commonly regarded as disabled or even, at worst, as \ndefective or deformed. Natural kinds do not just organize the natural and \nsocial world; they also provide a basis for evaluating and ranking various \nindividuals according to how closely they conform to the ideal.\nIn this respect, the concept of natural kinds functions much like the \nconcept of Platonic Forms.17 The theory of the Forms is addressed in \nmany of Plato’s works, but the allegory of the prisoners in the cave in \nBook VII of the The Republic offers a particularly vivid exposition (Plato, \n1991, pp.253–61). The allegory of the cave describes a group of prisoners \nchained up in such a way that they can see only shadows on the cave wall \nin front of them. The shadows are produced by physical objects placed \nbefore the fire behind them. An analogy is drawn between these imperfect \nshadows and the imperfection of the physical world. Just as physical \nobjects are more real and more perfect than mere shadows, so too are \nthe Forms more real and more perfect than any of the particular things \nencountered in the everyday world. Unlike the particulars that populate \nthe everyday world, Forms are perfect, eternal, universal abstractions, \nmuch like the concepts or categories of which the various particular \nthings are members.\nIf women and men constitute natural kinds, and natural kinds function \nas Platonic Forms, then it is no surprise that people approximate, \nbut do not fully instantiate, the categories they represent. Just as the \nancient ideal of masculine perfection represented in the figure of Adonis \nwas not realized by the average Greek citizen, the average member of \ncontemporary western culture is a similarly flawed representative of \nthe idealized category of womanhood or manhood. It is important to \nrecognize that people who deviate from the characteristics that are \nbelieved to define the categories to which they belong are not usually \nregarded as evidence against those defining characteristics. Instead, and \nconveniently, those defining characteristics are usually used as evidence \nthat there is something wrong with the people in question. Those who do \nnot manifest what Judith Butler (1990) refers to as ‘intelligible’ genders \nare regarded, at best, as different and, at worst, as deviant. According \nto Butler, genders are ‘intelligible’ to the extent that they ‘in some sense \ninstitute and maintain relations of coherence and continuity among sex, \ngender, sexual practice, and desire’ (Butler, 1990, p.17). In other words, \ngenders are ‘intelligible’ to the extent that they reflect and reinforce the \nhegemonic binary.\nIt is also important to recognize that the distinction between women \nand men is not just a straightforward division between two separate \nbut equal categories, natural kinds, or Platonic Forms. Implicit in the \ndistinction between women and men is an understanding of man as the \nideal. In fact, the distinction between the perfect Form and the imperfect \ncopy is replicated in the distinction between woman and man, female and \n",

That which is characteristically female or \nfeminine is generally regarded as inferior to that which is characteristically \nmale or masculine. As a result, women are in a contradictory situation \nsuch that meeting cultural expectations regarding ideal femininity would \nautomatically mean failing to meet cultural expectations regarding the \nhuman ideal, and meeting cultural expectations regarding the human ideal \nwould mean failing to meet cultural expectations of ideal femininity.\nTo conceptualize ‘women’ and ‘men’ as natural kind categories is to \naccept the twofold belief, first, that women and men are quite different \nfrom one another and, second, that the fundamental differences between \nwomen and men are attributable primarily to biology. In addition to \nreferring to biological kinds, however, ‘women’ and ‘men’ are sometimes \nunderstood to refer to what biologically male and female human beings \nbecome as the result of gender socialization. According to this second \nusage, ‘women’ and ‘men’ are not natural kind categories, but rather, \nthey are categories that exist at the intersection of nature and nurture. \nIn yet a third usage, ‘women’ and ‘men’ are regarded as purely social or \nexperiential categories. To put it another way, the terms ‘women’ and \n‘men’ sometimes designate sex, they sometimes designate gender, and \nthey sometimes designate the product of both sex and gender. It makes \nas much sense, for example, to make the ostensibly biological claim \nthat ‘Women produce eggs’ as it does to make the more obviously social \nclaim that ‘Men enjoy football’.\nThe ability to transition seamlessly from a biological conception of \n‘gender’ to a social one, or from biological definitions of ‘women’ and \n‘men’ to social ones, reinforces the hegemonic binary, which regards \ngender and sex, and even sexuality, as different expressions of the same \nfundamental division of the human world into its most basic natural \nkinds.18 Judith Lorber provides an apt description of the processes that \nshape gender, sex, and sexuality.\nFor the individual, gender construction starts with assignment to \na sex category on the basis of what the genitalia look like at birth. \nThen babies are dressed or adorned in a way that displays the \ncategory because parents don’t want to be constantly asked whether \ntheir baby is a girl or a boy. A sex category becomes a gender status \nthrough naming, dress, and the use of other gender markers. Once a \nchild’s gender is evident, others treat those in one gender differently \nfrom those in the other, and the children respond to the different \ntreatment by feeling different and behaving differently. As soon as \nthey can talk, they start to refer to themselves as members of their \ngender. Sex doesn’t come into play again until puberty, but by that \ntime, sexual feelings and desires and practices have been shaped by \ngendered norms and expectations. \n(Lorber, 1994, p.14)\n",

    "chunk_full": " \n79\nGender Defined and Undefined\nFollowing a trend associated with Judith Butler, Lorber refers to gender as \nan action or a process, rather than a static state or condition. Understood \nin this manner, gender is not so much who people are but what they do. \nIndeed, Lorber suggests that ‘everyone “does gender” without thinking \nabout it’ (Lorber, 1994, p.13). Borrowing from the example of drag \nperformance, Butler indicates that, unlike the imitation of the Forms, \nthe imitation that occurs in drag, or any other performance of gender, is \nan imitation that has no original. There is not something real that gender \nimitates. What gender imitates is simply other performances of gender, \nwhich are themselves mere imitations. Butler remarks that ‘gender is a \nkind of imitation for which there is no original; in fact, it is a kind of \nimitation that produces the very notion of the original as an effect and \nconsequence of the imitation itself’ (Butler, 1993, p.313).\nWhat Butler’s notion of performative gender offers is, first, a recognition \nof the active role that everyone plays in maintaining the hegemonic \nbinary and, second, an invitation to disrupt the hegemonic binary \nwhenever it proves to be too constricting. Thus, instead of attempting \nto repair the language and meaning surrounding existing categories of \ngender, sex, and sexuality, there is also the option, as expressed in the \ntitle of Butler’s 1990 book, of making ‘Gender Trouble’. Making gender \ntrouble simply means directing attention toward rather than away from \nthe limitations of existing categories, particularly the existing categories \nof gender, sex, and sexuality associated with the hegemonic binary. Thus, \nrather than attempting to resolve the dispute regarding gender-neutral \nlanguage and gender-inclusive language, a meaningful third option is to \nuse the problematic existing terminology, particularly when doing so is \nmost likely to emphasize mismatches within the categories of gender, sex, \nand sexuality associated with the hegemonic binary. This can also be \ncharacterized as a ‘queering’ of the established binaries. As explained by \nAnamarie Jagose, ‘queer’ refers to ‘those gestures or analytical models \nwhich dramatize incoherencies in the allegedly stable relations between \nchromosomal sex, gender and sexual desire’ (Jagose, 1996, p.3). To \ndisrupt the hegemonic binary, perhaps even in very small ways, serves to \n‘queer’ the paradigm. Making ‘Gender Trouble’, rather than attempting \nto resolve or eliminate such trouble, is thus a viable alternative for dealing \nwith the existence of the sorts of incoherencies that Jagose seems to have \nin mind.\nAdditional Resources \nWarren, V.

This is a queer country, and we may as \nwell take people as we find them.’ \n(L. Frank Baum, The Emerald City of Oz, p.225)\nFeminist Thought and Action\nThe notion of gender as performance (Butler, 1990; Lorber, 1994) serves \nas a reminder that gender is not simply about language and thought, \nbut it is also about action and lived experience. Gender is not theory \nremoved from practice, nor is feminism just an academic exercise. \nFeminism exists not just in response to but also in the form of the lived \nexperiences of real people. The thoughts and actions of those engaged in \nfeminist social and political movements affect the discourses produced \nby those engaged in feminist scholarship within women’s studies and \nrelated academic disciplines, and vice versa. The people engaged in \nfeminist social and political movements and the people engaged in \nfeminist scholarship are sometimes, in fact, the same people.\nFeminism as a social and political movement, particularly within \nthe USA, is often represented with the metaphor of waves that swell \nand retreat depending on the level of enthusiasm and need for feminist \nintervention. The first wave of the women’s movement is usually \nassociated with the suffrage movement that culminated in the passage of \nthe 19th amendment giving US women the legal right to vote in 1920. \nThe second wave is associated with what is often referred to as the \nwomen’s liberation movement, which led to a number of legal and social \ndevelopments, including an increase in women in the paid workforce and \nincreased attention to the problem of violence against women.

This was accompanied \nby a predictable increase in scholarly attention to feminist questions. \nThe distinction between sex and gender, which is still regarded as a core \nconcept within women’s studies and related fields, invites at least two such \nquestions. The first question asks whether women and men are biological \nor social phenomena, and the second asks whether women and men are \nfundamentally the same or fundamentally different. These are closely \nrelated questions. If women and men are regarded as fundamentally \nthe same, then this would suggest that any differences that exist are \naccidental, or learned differences. If what it means to be a woman or \na man is learned then women and men are fundamentally the same in \nterms of biology. In a world without gender, or at least without gender \nsocialization, would people be more like the androgynous characters \nthat inhabit the fictional future imagined in Marge Piercy’s 1976 novel \nWoman on the Edge of Time?1 \nThis tension between sameness and difference is an important issue \nwithin feminist scholarship. In their 2006 reader, Theorizing Feminisms, \nElizabeth Hackett and Sally Haslanger identify three general approaches \nfor theorizing sex oppression. These include the ‘sameness’ approach, \nalso described as humanist feminism, and the ‘difference’ approach, also \ndescribed as gynocentric feminism.2 The sameness approach is referred to \nas humanist presumably on the basis of an underlying assumption that, \nbecause women and men are fundamentally the same, it is unnecessary \nto differentiate between them. In other words, respect for humans in \ngeneral ultimately amounts to respect for women in particular.3 These \ntwo models are not the only way of characterizing conceptual differences \namong the various theoretical approaches collected under the banner \nof feminism. For example, Hackett and Haslanger also acknowledge a \nthird perspective, namely the ‘dominance’ approach, which abandons \nquestions about sameness and difference to concentrate instead on the \nsubordination of women.\nThis conceptual space can also be divided along different boundaries. \nFor example, where Hackett and Haslanger refer to the tension between \nsameness and difference, or between humanist and gynocentric versions \nof feminism, others employ the more familiar labels, liberal feminism and \ncultural feminism. Where Hackett and Haslanger refer to the dominance \napproach, others refer to radical feminism. Tong’s Feminist Thought \n(1989, 1998, 2008) and Jaggar and Rothenberg’s Feminist Frameworks \n",

The 1989 edition of Feminist Thought divides the \nfield into liberal feminism, radical feminism, Marxist feminism, cultural \nfeminism, psychoanalytic feminism, socialist feminism, existentialist \nfeminism, and postmodern feminism. The 1998 edition made a few \nchanges, and the 2008 update made even more. Tong’s current inventory \nof the various positions within feminism includes liberal feminism, radical \nfeminism, Marxist and socialist feminism, psychoanalytic feminism, \ncare-centred feminism; multicultural, global, and postcolonial feminism; \necofeminism; and, finally, postmodern and third-wave feminism. Jaggar \nand Rothenberg’s Feminist Frameworks provides a similarly updated set \nof categories with each new edition, but it has not been updated since \n1993, when it referred only to liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, \nradical feminism, socialist feminism, multicultural feminism, and global \nfeminism. Finally, in a noteworthy article in Bitch Magazine, Rachel \nFudge (2006) offered an account of the major trends within feminist \nscholarship and activism.4 According to Fudge, the major trends within \nfeminism include liberal feminism, radical feminism, cultural feminism \n(which is also identified as essentialist feminism or difference feminism), \nand third-wave feminism.\nAs suggested by the differences among various publications, and \neven across editions of the same publications, the proposed categories \nfor distinguishing the various forms of feminism do not represent all \nperspectives equally well. Such categories are nevertheless useful for \norganizing the otherwise diverse body of literature loosely collected \nunder the banner of feminism. Assuming that the areas of greatest \noverlap among the different categories can be taken as evidence of their \nwidespread acceptance and well-established significance, the noteworthy \nforms of feminist theory would seem to include liberal feminism, Marxist \nfeminism, radical feminism, and socialist feminism, and it would also \nseem that the field is expanding to include multicultural feminism and \nglobal feminism as well.\nSo far, ‘feminist theory’ has been used in reference to theorizing \nthat addresses feminist questions and concerns. A closely related sort \nof theorizing that is also relevant to the present discussion is feminist \nphilosophy, whereby a feminist perspective, attitude, or orientation is \napplied to philosophical questions and concerns. Feminist ethics, in \nwhich a feminist perspective is applied to the study of morality, and \nfeminist epistemology, in which a feminist perspective is applied to the \nstudy of knowledge, are two examples. The two schools of thought \nmost commonly identified as uniquely feminist ways of thinking about \nethics are the ethics of care and ecofeminism. To identify the schools of \nthought most commonly identified as feminist ways of thinking about \nepistemology, it may be useful to turn to Sandra Harding’s ‘Rethinking \nStandpoint Epistemology: What is “Strong” Objectivity?’ (1993) and \n",

With the addition of \npostmodern feminism and third-wave feminism, the inventory of the \nvarious articulations of feminism now includes liberal feminism, Marxist \nfeminism, radical feminism, socialist feminism, multicultural feminism, \nglobal feminism, ethics of care, ecofeminism, feminist empiricism, \nfeminist standpoint theory, postmodern feminism, and finally third-wave \nfeminism.\nFeminist Theory\nTwo classic pieces set the tone for much of the early feminist literature. \nThese include Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of \nWoman (1967), originally published in 1792, and John Stuart Mill’s ‘The \nSubjection of Women’ (1970), originally published in 1869.

Like political liberalism, liberal feminism denies \nthat accident of birth is sufficient to justify an inequitable distribution \nof good, including such intangible goods as rights and opportunities. \nBy rejecting the notion that nature warrants the subordinate status of \nwomen, liberal feminism gives birth to the distinction between sex and \ngender. According to liberal feminism, sexism is the product of bad \nreasoning, and the goal of feminism is to make the necessary corrections, \nparticularly within the legal system. John Stuart Mill explains the proper \nrole of reason, rather than prejudice, in determining the proper treatment \nof women:\nThe least that can be demanded is, that the question should not \nbe considered as prejudged by existing fact and existing opinion, \nbut open to discussion on its merits, as a question of justice and \nexpediency: the decision on this, as on any of the other social \narrangements of mankind, depending on what an enlightened \nestimate of tendencies and consequences may show to be most \nadvantageous to humanity in general, without distinction of \nsex.

If it \nbe said that the doctrine of the equality of the sexes rests only on \ntheory, it must be remembered that the contrary doctrine also has \nonly theory to rest upon. \n(Mill, 1970, p.147)\nIt is worth noting that Alice Walker (1983) articulated womanism as \nalternative to the white, sometimes even racist, orientation of mainstream \nfeminism. Rachel Fudge lists womanism under the larger heading of \nliberal feminism, presumably because womanism shares with liberal \nfeminism an interest in liberation strategies. The difference, however, \nis that womanism, unlike liberal feminism, addresses intersectionality. \nIntersectionality refers to the simultaneous impact of race, gender, and \nclass on the lives of Black women (Davis, 1981; Crenshaw, 1994).\nA frequent criticism of liberal feminism addresses the ideals of \nequality and autonomy associated with liberalism. Consider divorce law, \nfor example. At a time when wage labour was impractical for the vast \nmajority of white, middle class and upper-middle class US and European \nhousewives, due to lack of relevant training and social pressure to stay \nat home, alimony was critical for the survival of most divorced women. \nAccordingly, early feminists supported legal measures aimed at creating \ngenuine opportunities for women to escape bad marital situations. In \nthe context of an ideology based on autonomy and equality, however, \nto identify women, or at least housewives, as a class of people in need \nof special legal protection denies their status as equal and autonomous \nmembers of society.\nDissatisfaction with liberal feminism invites an analysis of the \nstructural constraints contributing to the subordination of women, \nparticularly capitalism. Just as Marxism identifies capitalism as the source \nof oppression, Marxist feminism (for example Reed, 1970) identifies \ncapitalism as the source of women’s oppression. On this account, the role \nof women within contemporary western society is rooted not in biology \nbut in the rise of capitalism. From this perspective, the remedy is obvious. \nAlthough women have traditionally done most of the domestic labour, \nthis labour goes unacknowledged by a social system that presupposed \nthe economic dependence of women on men. Women need power, which \nderives from economic leverage. Marxist feminism therefore advocates \nthe socialization of domestic labour or the more thorough integration of \nwomen into the wage labour system.\nMarxist feminism has been criticized for reducing women’s oppression \nto a subcategory of economic oppression. In a now famous analysis of \nrape, Catharine MacKinnon (1987) addresses the limitations of both \nliberal and Marxist approaches to feminism. On an economic model, rape \nis construed as an issue of property rights. Sex becomes rape only when \n",

The legal distinction between rape \nand consensual sex, according to MacKinnon, fosters this interpretation. \nIt reinforces the role of men as those who seek a commodity, namely \nsex, that is owned by women (or their fathers, husbands, brothers, and \nother protectors). MacKinnon claims that, by differentiating between \nsex and rape, some feminist analyses inadvertently perpetuate a system \nof sexual violence against women. For this reason, MacKinnon adopts \nradical feminism and advocates voluntary lesbianism as an alternative to \nthe power symmetry inherent in heterosexual relationships.\nAdrienne Rich also advocates voluntary lesbianism, which is used \nalmost interchangeably with woman-identification, as an alternative to \nthe oppressive system that enforces the heterosexual norm:\nWoman-identification is a source of energy, a potential springhead \nof female power, violently curtailed and wasted under the institution \nof heterosexuality. The denial of reality and visibility to women’s \npassion for women, women’s choice of women as allies, life \ncompanions, and community; the forcing of such relationships into \ndissimulation and their disintegration under intense pressure have \nmeant an incalculable loss to the power of all women to change the \nsocial relations of the sexes, to liberate ourselves and each other. \nThe lie of compulsory female heterosexuality today afflicts not just \nfeminist scholarship, but every profession, every reference work, \nevery curriculum, every organizing attempt, every relationship or \nconversation over which it hovers. It creates, specifically, a profound \nfalseness, hypocrisy, and hysteria in the heterosexual dialogue, for \nevery heterosexual relationship is lived in the queasy strobelight of \nthat lie. However we choose to identify ourselves, however we find \nourselves labeled, it flickers across and distorts our lives. \n(Rich, 1980, p.657)\nWhile not all radical feminists oppose heterosexuality, they do tend \nto agree that it is historically and socially problematic (for example \nBunch, 1975; Rich, 1980). This is because heterosexual relationships \noften perpetuate patriarchy. Patriarchy is best characterized as a social \nstructure that grants priority to that which is male or masculine over that \nwhich is female or feminine. Various articulations of radical feminism \nare unified by their mutual critique of patriarchy as the fundamental \nsource of sexism.\nSocialist feminism emerges as something of a synthesis of Marxist \nand radical feminisms. Socialist feminism opposes the primacy of \nclass in Marxist analyses and of sex in radical analyses, and instead \nregards capitalism and male sexual dominance as equal partners in the \nsubordination of women (for example Hartmann, 1981).

According to socialist feminism, lower classes of men \nare simultaneously privileged and disadvantaged. They possess power in \nrelation to women, but they lack power in the larger social context. Since \nmen have no immediate or obvious interest in relinquishing power over \nwomen, socialist reform will be insufficient unless it is also feminist.\nFinally, multicultural and global feminisms both exhibit interest in, \nand respect for, the lived experiences of women who are outside the \nmainstream culture of white Americans and Europeans. Multicultural \nfeminism (for example Collins, 1990; Anzaldua, 1987), also sometimes \nreferred to as ‘women of colour feminism’, addresses the unique issues \nthat racial and ethnic minority women experience as a result of the \nintersecting influences of gender, race, class, and sexuality on cultural \nidentities.5 Consider, for example, Anzaldua’s discussion of the dual \nidentity developed as a Mestiza, or border dweller:\nAs a mestiza I have no country, my homeland cast me out; yet all \ncountries are mine because I am every woman’s sister or potential \nlover. (As a lesbian I have no race, my own people disclaim me; but \nI am all races because there is the queer of me in all races.) \n(Anzaldua, 1987, p.80)\nGlobal feminism (for example Mies, 1986; Enloe, 1995) represents a \nbroader perspective which regards the lives of all women as inextricably \ninterconnected, regardless of their geographic and political separation. \nIn particular, global feminism examines the impact of imperialism and \ncolonialism, thereby bringing international politics to the analysis of \nwomen’s issues. Consider, for instance, Cynthia Enloe’s (1995) influential \narticle ‘The Globetrotting Sneaker’, which exposed the impact on \npeople in general, but particularly on women and their children, when \nmultinational corporations like Nike exploit the workers and natural \nresources in vulnerable parts of the world. \nDespite an unmistakable solidarity among those interested in feminist \ntheory and those interested in lesbian and gay rights, there are significant \nconceptual tensions between the feminist theory produced by the second \nwave and some of the ideas associated with traditional lesbian and gay \nstudies. The liberal feminism of the second wave employs a conception \nof rights borrowed from liberal political theory. According to liberal \nfeminism, women and men are fundamentally the same and should, \ntherefore, be afforded the same rights and opportunities. Among the first \nto differentiate between sex as a matter of biology and gender as a product \nof society, second-wave liberal feminists argue that the vast majority of \nobservable differences between the sexes are learned rather than innate. \nAccording to this position, the only thing that separates women and men \n",

The effectiveness of this position as a foundation for \nequality of rights and opportunities is made especially clear by Gloria \nSteinem’s oft-quoted claim that, ‘There are very few jobs that actually \nrequire a penis or vagina – all others should be open to everyone.’\nLike liberal feminism, the contemporary lesbian and gay rights \nmovement aims to secure equality of rights and opportunities regardless \nof differences in sexuality. Just as liberal feminists argue that women and \nmen are fundamentally the same, separated only by sex organs, many \nlesbian and gay rights activists likewise argue that homosexuals and \nheterosexuals, separated only by sexuality, are fundamentally the same.\nWhereas liberal feminism invokes socialization as the underlying \ncause of most differences between women and men, the lesbian and gay \nrights movement rejects socialization as a determining factor in the case \nof sexual orientation. Thus, where liberal feminism regards biological \ndeterminism with suspicion, the lesbian and gay rights movement often \nendorses it.\nOne interpretation of the slogan ‘the personal is political’, commonly \nattributed to second-wave feminists, is that social acceptance of domestic \nviolence can be reversed only by drawing attention to such problems. In \nother words, what happens behind closed doors is not merely a private \nmatter, but rather an extension of the social inequalities between women \nand men. In contrast, lesbian and gay rights activists often argue that \nwhat happens behind closed doors is strictly a private matter. According \nto second-wave feminism, intimate relationships are of public and \npolitical concern; according to the lesbian and gay rights movement, they \nare private and personal.\nAnother interpretation of ‘the personal is political’, associated with \nthe more radical feminism of the second wave, is that social institutions, \nmost notably compulsory heterosexuality, perpetuate and reinforce the \noppression of women by men. On this position, heterosexuality should be \nrejected in favour of voluntary lesbianism. Lesbian existence is regarded \nas something that can and should be chosen as a form of political \nresistance. This runs counter to the virtually unanimous agreement \nwithin the lesbian and gay rights movement that sexual orientation is \ninnate, rather than something that involves an element of choice.

In the \nearly 1980s, research by Carol Gilligan (1982), Nel Noddings (1984), \nand others suggested that girls and women may be disposed toward a \ndifferent style of ethical reasoning than boys and men. Specifically, they \nsuggested that ethics based on the natural impulse to care for others \nprovides a feminine and feminist alternative to more familiar systems \nof ethics that are based on notions of justice. One concern raised in \nconnection with the ethics of care is its apparent commitment to gender \nessentialism. A related concern is that, by linking women with care, \nit reinforces the historical relegation of women to domestic labour \nperformed largely as a service to others.\nAlthough the ethics of care has fallen out of favour somewhat, especially \nwhen compared to its overwhelming popularity in the late 1980s and \nearly 90s, there is still a great deal of interest in finding alternatives to \ntraditional approaches to ethics, which have tended to concentrate on \nthe use of reason by individual moral agents. The two most commonly \nreferenced positions within traditional ethics are deontological ethics, \nespecially in the example of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant’s \nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1998), first published in \n1785,7 and teleological ethics, especially in the example of the utilitarian \nposition advanced by John Stuart Mill (2001) in 1863.8 Kant and Mill \nprovide different rules for differentiating between conduct that is morally \nright and conduct that is morally wrong, but they both agree that there are \nuniversal rules by which to differentiate between conduct that is morally \nright and conduct that is morally wrong. In addition, both Kant and \nMill, like most philosophers working within the contemporary western \ntradition, regard morality as the achievement of individuals making \npersonal choices in the face of moral dilemmas. The ethics of care offers \nan alternative account in which morality is situated in relationships as a \nwhole, rather than in discreet choices and actions or the moral rules that \ngovern those choices and actions.\nLike the ethics of care, ecofeminism resists the temptation to supply \nuniversal moral rules, and seeks instead to reveal and address what Karen \nWarren (2000) refers to as ‘the logic of domination’ in the relationships \nbetween people or groups of people, and also in the relationships between \npeople or groups of people and other parts of the natural world:\nAccording to ecological feminists (‘ecofeminists’), important \nconnections exist between the treatment of women, people of color, \nand the underclass on one hand and the treatment of nonhuman \nnature on the other. Ecological feminists claim that any feminism, \nenvironmentalism, or environmental ethic which fails to take \nthese connections seriously is grossly inadequate.

In order to understand this critique, however, it is important \nto have a basic understanding of traditional epistemology, particularly \nlogical positivism. Logical empiricism, sometimes referred to as logical \npositivism, describes the union of positivism, or empiricism, and logic. \nPositivism is the belief that statements are meaningful only if they are \nverifiable through experience. Logic is a system for analysing the formal \nrelationships between and among statements. Logical empiricism thus \nrefers to an account whereby knowledge, especially scientific knowledge, \nis produced when empirically verifiable data, in the form of observation \nstatements, are subjected to logical analysis in order to confirm or \ndisconfirm a range of theories and hypotheses. This account presupposes \nthat it is both possible and desirable for scientists and other epistemic \nagents to be neutral in the collection and evaluation of data, such that a \ngiven epistemic agent is, or at least should be, virtually interchangeable \nwith any other epistemic agent.\nFeminist empiricism shares with logical empiricism a commitment \nto scientific neutrality, but denies that sexism and other forms of bias \nare easily avoided. Feminist empiricists have exposed numerous cases in \nwhich predominantly male scientific communities have misrepresented \nor ignored women and, as result, have generated faulty conclusions. \nFor instance, the exclusive use of male subjects in experiments intended \nfor generalization to the larger human population is no longer deemed \nacceptable, largely because feminist empiricists have revealed the \nhidden biases of this practice. Indeed, the ethics of care emerged as an \nalternative traditional ethics precisely because feminist research on moral \ndevelopment in children revealed that earlier work had concentrated \nalmost exclusively on boys. According to feminist empiricism, sexist \nscience occurs when scientists fail to reason as carefully and neutrally as \nthey should. Thus, the role of feminist empiricism is largely corrective.\nCritics of feminist empiricism note that careless reasoning is not \nthe only problem in science that feminism must address. Consider, \nfor example, the accusation that, throughout recent history, medical \nscience has devoted more resources to the health care needs of men \nthan to the health care needs of women.

Whereas feminist \nempiricism reiterates the traditional claim that all rational agents are \nepistemologically equal, standpoint theory (as represented, for example \nin Harding, 2003) suggests that social boundaries can act as epistemic \nboundaries, and epistemic agents will seek only the sorts of knowledge \nto which they have access. Standpoint theory borrows from Marxism the \nsuggestion that those living under conditions of domination have a more \ncomplete perspective than their oppressors (Smith, 1987, pp.78–88). \nOn this account, epistemic communities consist of a dominant group, \nor centre, and a dominated group, or margin (refer to Figure 7.1). From \nthe margin, someone gains an outsider’s perspective on the centre, and \nis thereby better equipped to expose the limitations of the dominant \nideology. Using the physical boundary drawn by railroad tracks as a \nmetaphor for the marginal social location of those outside the dominant \ngroup, bell hooks describes this dual perspective:\nTo be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the \nmain body. For black Americans living in a small Kentucky town, \nthe railroad tracks were a daily reminder of our marginality. \nAcross those tracks were paved streets, stores we could not enter, \nrestaurants we could not eat in, and people we could not look \ndirectly in the face. Across those tracks was a world we could work \nin as maids, as janitors, as prostitutes, as long as it was in a service \ncapacity. We could enter that world, but we could not live there. \nWe had always to return to the margin, to beyond the tracks, to \nshacks and abandoned houses on the edge of town.\nThere were laws to ensure our return. To not return was to risk \nbeing punished. Living as we did – on the edge – we developed a \nparticular way of seeing reality. We looked both from the outside \nin and from the inside out. We focused our attention on the center \nas well as on the margin. We understood both. This mode of seeing \nreminded us of the existence of a whole universe, a main body \nmade up of both margin and center. Our survival depended on an \nongoing public awareness of the separation between margin and \ncenter and an ongoing private acknowledgment that we were a \nnecessary, vital part of that whole. \n(hooks, 2000, p.xvi, emphasis added)\nLike feminist empiricism, the role of standpoint theory is largely corrective. \nAgain like feminist empiricism, standpoint theory implies that some \nperspectives are epistemologically preferable to others. Unlike feminist \nempiricism, however, standpoint theory indicates that the corrective, \nprivileged perspective can be achieved only from the social margins.\n",

Feminist standpoint theory describes a social world in which \nthe position of women is marginal to the position of men. But there \nare, of course, contexts in which the position of particular women is \nmarginal to the position of other women, as well as contexts in which \nthe position of particular men is marginal to the position of other \nmen. Attention to race, class, sexuality, and other factors disrupts the \nnotion that there is a straightforward boundary between insiders and \noutsiders. If the marginal perspective of women is generally preferable \nto the perspective of men, then it would seem that the more marginal \nperspective of Black women would be preferable to the perspective of \nwhite women, the more marginal perspective of poor Black women \nwould be preferable to the perspective of middle-class or wealthy Black \nwomen, and so on.9\nInstead of degenerating into debates over which groups are more \nmarginal that others, many feminists simply acknowledge, first, that \nperspectives acquired as a result of social positioning impact the production \nof knowledge and, second, that epistemic communities can benefit from \nseeking input from multiple perspectives (for example Longino, 1990). \nSome prescribe multiple perspectives as a means of correcting the \nimplicit biases of particular perspectives. Others suggest that multiple \nperspectives can work together to provide a more complete perspective. \nThis approach, which can be usefully identified as perspectival pluralism, \nabandons the rigid dichotomy between insiders and outsiders associated \nwith early versions of standpoint theory.\nMARGINAL\nCENTRAL\n",

In order \nto understand postmodern feminism, it will be helpful first to have \na basic understanding of postmodernism. In order to understand \npostmodernism, it will be helpful first to have a basic understanding of \nmodernism. In everyday usage, ‘modern’ refers literally to whatever is \nnew, whatever is happening at the current moment. In its more technical \nusage, ‘modernism’ refers to specific eras and schools of thought within \na variety of different domains, such as philosophy, science studies, art \nhistory, literary criticism, film theory, and so on. What modernism means \nfor science studies, for example, may have very little in common with \nwhat it means for art history or any other field. Addressing very briefly its \nusage in philosophy, the modern era began around the beginning of the \n17th century, against the historical backdrop of the scientific revolution, \nand lasted into the beginning of the 19th century, in the context of the \nEnlightenment. The Enlightenment is perhaps best described as a general \nattitude of celebration and optimism about the potential use of reason to \nobtain truth and achieve the highest human potential. This optimism is \nprecisely what postmodernism leaves behind.\nFor postmodernism in general, and for postmodern feminism in \nparticular, there is no absolute truth. Any attempt to distinguish fact \nfrom fiction is thus a political project, based as much in ideology and \nvalues as it is in evidence and logic. For postmodern feminism, in which \npostmodernism is applied to the subject matter of feminism, this means \nthat there is no underlying truth about sex or gender. In a particularly \nprovocative statement of this position, Judith Butler has suggested not \njust that gender is socially constructed, but that sex itself is also socially \nconstructed. Sex, Butler claims, ‘is an ideal construct which is forcibly \nmaterialized through time. It is not a simple fact or static condition of \na body, but a process whereby regulatory norms materialize “sex” and \nachieve this materialization through a forcible reiteration of those norms’ \n(Butler, 1993, pp.1–2).\nQueer Theory\nThere is quite a lot of overlap across the categories outlined above. There \nis an obvious connection between first-wave feminism, liberal feminism, \nand feminist empiricism. In each case, the proper role for feminism is to \npromote the diligent application of reason as a means to achieve truth \nand justice. There is also a connection between multicultural feminism \nand feminist standpoint theory. Both promote awareness of and \nappreciation for the social positioning of those outside the dominant \nmainstream identity categories.

Finally, in a connection that \nwill be discussed in more detail in the Chapter 8, postmodern feminism \noverlaps with both third-wave feminism and queer theory.\nThird-wave feminism describes the newest generations of feminists at \na time in history when many have suggested that, at least for women in \nmost of Europe and North America, feminism is no longer necessary. In \nfact, when Rebecca Walker referred to the ‘third-wave’ in 1992, thereby \npopularizing the term, it was in response to the suggestion in a New York \nTimes article that a post-feminist era was underway (Baumgardner and \nRichards, 2000, p.77). While some challenge the notion of third-wave \nfeminism by claiming that the second wave was successful enough that \nsexism is no longer a significant problem, others challenge the notion \nof third-wave feminism by claiming that the second wave has not yet \ncompleted its work.10\nFigure 7.2 Rubin’s sex hierarchy: the charmed circle vs. the outer limits\nSource: Rubin, 1992, p.281\n",

    "chunk_full": " \n97\nFeminism Examined and Explored\nThird-wave feminism is not easily defined, partly because it is still in \nthe process of establishing itself, and partly because one of the features \ncommon across different articulations of third-wave feminism is its \nrecognition that there are multiple versions of what it means to be a \nfeminist, or even a third-wave feminism. In fact, one common thread that \nconnects postmodern feminism, third-wave feminism, and queer theory is \nthe concern than an attempt to define something is ultimately an attempt \nto exert control. As depicted by Gayle Rubin’s ‘charmed circle’ (refer to \nFigure 7.2), the process of defining sex is also the process of controlling \nit through the simultaneous formation of a distinction between sex that \nis ‘normal’ and sex that is ‘deviant’.  Depicted as a circle with a dominant \ncore and an exterior margin, Rubin’s charmed circle is reminiscent of \nthe depiction of marginal and central social positions associated with \nfeminist standpoint theory (refer to Figure 7.1). At the centre are socially \nprescribed sexual activities and practices, surrounded on the margins by \nsocially prohibited sexual activities and practices.\nIn a published conversation between Judith Butler and Gayle Rubin, \nRubin explained that this analysis developed partly as a response \nto feminist articulations of the difference between acceptable and \nunacceptable sexual activities and practices, many of which drove a \nwedge between feminists and gay men.\nFeminism was also used quite a bit as the political theory of gay \nmale politics, and it didn’t work very well. Very little gay male \nbehavior actually was granted the feminist seal of approval. Most \nof the actual practice of gay male culture was objectionable to many \nfeminists, who mercilessly condemned drag and cross-dressing, gay \npublic sex, gay male promiscuity, gay male masculinity, gay leather, \ngay fist-fucking, gay cruising, and just about everything else gay \nmen did. I could not accept the usual lines about why all this stuff \nwas terrible and anti-feminist, and thought they were frequently an \nexpression of reconstituted homophobia. \n(Rubin, as interviewed by Butler, 1994, pp.76)\nRubin recognizes that gender, sex, and sexuality are intimately \nconnected. Indeed, it was Rubin (1975) who first referred to the ‘sex-\ngender system’ to describe ‘the set of arrangements by which a society \ntransforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and \nin which these transformed sexual needs are satisfied’ (Rubin, 1975, \np.159). What this example demonstrates is that directing attention to \nall three of the interrelated concepts of gender, sex, and sexuality reveals \nforms of bias that might otherwise go unnoticed and unchallenged. In \naddition, this example invites an exploration of possible alternatives to \nthe existing system of gender, sex, and sexuality.\n",

Even a \ncursory internet search will reveal various articles and pages dedicated \nto some variant of queer feminism. I do not believe that what I refer \nto as queer feminism is wholly original, however, nor do I believe that \nthe development of new ideas is ever wholly original given the social \ncharacter of knowledge production. Instead, I conceive of my project as \npart of a larger emerging trend situated at the intersection of feminism \nand queer theory.\nWhat I refer to as queer feminism is simply the application of queer \nnotions of gender, sex, and sexuality to the subject matter of feminist \ntheory, and the simultaneous application of feminist notions of gender, \nsex, and sexuality to the subject matter of queer theory. Although the \nword ‘queer’ is commonly associated with sex and sexuality, queer theory \nis a way of understanding not just sex and sexuality but also gender. \nSpecifically, queer theory avoids the binary and hierarchical reasoning \nusually associated with these concepts. Precisely what it is that constitutes \nthe subject matter of feminism varies from one form of feminism to the \nnext. Despite this diversity, however, almost every form of feminism \naddresses at least gender and sex, and sometimes sexuality as well. There \nis thus an implicit connection between queer theory and feminist theory, \nand queer feminism makes this connection more explicit. \nQueer feminism brings both a queer orientation to feminist theory, \nand a feminist orientation to queer theory. Part of what makes the union \nof queer and feminist theory so inviting is that they already have much \nin common. As I have already noted, both address the intersecting issues \n",

In the case of feminist theory, the \nemphasis is on gender and sex. An obvious outcome of uniting queer and \nfeminist theory, then, is that the addition of a queer perspective promises \nto direct increased attention toward sexuality in the context of feminist \ntheory, while the addition of a feminist perspective promises to direct \nincreased attention to gender in the context of queer theory.\nThere are other concerns and consequences connected with the \nqueering of feminism, of course, because queer theory does much more \nthan simply accentuate sexuality. Because feminist theory does more \nthan simply accentuate gender, there are likewise additional interests \nand issues associated with the explicit insertion of feminism into queer \ntheory. The significance of bringing a queer orientation to feminist theory \nis addressed in the first section below, and the significance of bringing a \nfeminist orientation to queer theory is addressed in the second section \nbelow. \nThe Queer in Queer Feminism\nThere is an unmistakable sense of solidarity linking concern about \nwomen’s issues and concern about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender issues. This solidarity seems to have more depth than the \nmere recognition that feminism must reflect the lives of women who \nidentify as heterosexual as well as those who do not. This solidarity also \nseems to have more depth than the mere recognition that all people are \nentitled to equality of rights and opportunities. Instead, this solidarity \nseems born of a deep understanding that the oppression of women and \nthe suppression of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender existence are \ndeeply intertwined. Feminist identity, like LGBT identity, stretches the \nboundaries of established categories of gender, sex, and sexuality.\nDespite the implicit connection they share, there is a history of tension \nbetween feminist studies and sexuality studies, both in general and in \nthe more specific case of queer theory. There is evidence of bias against \nlesbian women,1 gay men,2 bisexual people,3 and transgender people4 \nwithin the feminist canon. The explicit emphasis queer feminism places \non sexuality can go a long way toward preventing such problems. A \nrelated issue is that there is also a history of racism and classism within \nthe feminist canon.5 Queer theory’s critique of binary and hierarchical \nreasoning recognizes and addresses all forms of oppression as part of \na logic of domination. The logic of domination is also a concern raised \nwithin ecofeminism, as discussed in Chapter 7. The logic of domination \nis a way of thinking about and interacting with the world and its \ninhabitants that is structured hierarchically in a manner that justifies the \nsystematic subordination of those who lack power by those who possess \n",

    "chunk_full": " \n107\nNotes Toward a Queer Feminism\nit. The critique of the logic of domination offered by both some forms of \nfeminism and queer theory promises to keep a check on racism, classism, \nand other expressions of oppression.\nIt is worth noting, however, that queer theory, like feminist theory, \nalso has a history of racism and classism. What this suggests is that bias is \npervasive, and a theoretical orientation that promises or aims to address \na particular form of bias is never immune from perpetuating it. Not every \ncritique that aims to attend to oppression will do so equally successfully. \nThis realization can lead, especially initially, to a sense of despair regarding \nthe possibility of avoiding or eliminating bias. At the same time, however, \nit can also serve as a reminder of how important it is to filter ideas through \nmultiple disciplinary and personal screens. This process offers what may \nbe our best chance of catching and removing as much of the residual \ndebris of unintentional bias as possible. Indeed, the linking of queer and \nfeminist perspectives layers yet another screen onto the filter. Because \nqueer theory, and hence queer feminism, embraces multiplicity, there is \nno limit to this layering of screens in various combinations. Just as I am \neager to integrate and articulate queer feminism, others have integrated \nand articulated queer perspectives on other fields as well.6\nAnother consequence of linking queer theory with feminism is that \nit signals a direction for feminism to take at a time when it seems to be \nsearching for direction. In particular, it directs contemporary feminism, \nparticularly third-wave feminism, away from a less appealing position \nthat some, including Elizabeth Kissling (in Grigg-Spall, 2010), refer to \nas post-feminism. Kissling’s reference to post-feminism is not intended \nto signal the end of feminism, but instead identifies the disingenuous \nprocess of ‘taking feminism into account in order to dismiss it’. Post-\nfeminism seems to suggest that the necessary conditions are already in \nplace to achieve such feminist ideals as social and economic equality \nbetween women and men. Women simply need to take advantage of \nthe opportunities already available. This is reminiscent of the attitude \nprevalent in the USA following the passage of the 19th amendment in \n1920, which is often regarded as the culmination of the first wave of \nfeminism. It was widely assumed that allowing women to vote put the \nnecessary conditions in place to achieve such feminist ideals as social \nand economic equality. Women simply needed to exercise the elective \nfranchise. They simply needed to make their choices. Similarly, post-\nfeminism upholds the ability to make choices as emblematic of feminism. \nThis is prevalent in popular western culture, and especially pronounced in \nthe makeover genre of television programming and magazine copy, where \nfreedom of expression among women is often reduced to the ‘freedom’, \nprovided they have sufficient financial resources, for women to ‘choose’ \na range of risky cosmetic surgeries. Casting this as an issue of free choice \nmeans missing the opportunity to critique the cultural conditions under \nwhich women are socialized to believe that our otherwise healthy bodies \n",

This is not altogether surprising since both exist in \nresponse to, indeed as an alternative to, second-wave feminism. Recall, \nafter all, that Rebecca Walker helped to popularize the expression, \nthird wave, in response to a declaration in the New York Times that the \nfeminist era was over and the post-feminist era had begun (Baumgardner \nand Richards, 2000, p.77). Indeed, both post-feminism and third-wave \nfeminism take for granted that second-wave feminism has outlived its \nusefulness. For post-feminism, this is because it has already accomplished \nits mission, thus providing contemporary women with a wide range of \noptions from which to make our precious choices. For the third wave, \nit is simply because second-wave feminism is outdated when compared \nwith more contemporary approaches to dismantling patriarchy, such as \nthose featured in the final section of this chapter. An important feature \nof post-feminism is that, whereas queer theory, third-wave feminism, \nand hence queer feminism provide a critical perspective on mainstream \nculture, post-feminism reinforces it by promoting choice, often consumer \nchoice, masquerading under a façade of feminist expression. Queer \nfeminism thus presents a welcome path toward the ongoing development \nof feminism as a critical perspective.\nThe Feminism in Queer Feminism\nJust as there has been a history of bias against lesbian women, gay men, \nbisexual people, and transgender people within feminism, there also has \nbeen a history of bias against women within sexuality studies, including \nqueer theory.7 The explicit emphasis queer feminism places on gender is \nan obvious strategy toward preventing such problems. In addition, just \nas there has been a history of racism and classism in the feminist canon, \nthere is likewise a history of racism and classism in the queer canon.8 \nOnce again, I suggest that the addition of another critical perspective, \nor the layering of additional screens can be useful in filtering out such \nbiases as they occur.\nDespite its value in addressing forms of oppression within queer \ntheory, the pairing of the term feminism with the term queer is not at \nall unproblematic. One consequence of the radical critique of binary \nthinking that queer theory offers is that it seems to deny the reality of any \ncategories, including not just categories of gender, such as feminine, but \nalso categories of sex, such as female. If there are not really any females, \nif there is nothing that really is feminine, if there are no women, indeed \nnot even any men, then there would seem to be little value in a theoretical \nperspective organized around sex and gender identity.

    "chunk_full": " \n109\nNotes Toward a Queer Feminism\n‘feminism’ is referential of the existing sex and gender binaries, it might \nseem to be at odds with the rejection of binary forms of categorization. \nDespite this apparent contradiction, I have chosen the problematic \nlabel ‘queer feminism’ intentionally, in full knowledge of the irony it \nexhibits. For one thing, I have learned enough from poststructuralism, \nand especially from Derrida,9 to understand that, while meaning cannot \nbe fixed permanently, it can be, indeed it must be, constantly negotiated \nfor reference in particular contexts. This is how sexism, racism, and \nmany other forms of oppression are able to function. Expectations and \nideals are constantly revisited and revised, and this is part of what makes \nthem so hard to achieve. Nevertheless, these expectations and ideals form \nthe standards against which we are judged. In the response to sexism and \nracism, it is also necessary to recognize how the relevant meanings have \nbeen fixed relative to the oppressive contexts in which they are deployed. \nThis is reminiscent of what Gayatri Spivak referred to in 1985 as ‘strategic \nessentialism’ (Spivak, 1996). Strategic essentialism is a strategy whereby \ngroups with mutual goals and interests temporarily present themselves \npublicly as essentially the same for the sake of expediency and presenting \na united front, while simultaneously engaging in ongoing and less public \ndisagreement and debate.\nAdditionally, by using the term, I hope to draw attention to the \nproblems inherent in the very notion of ‘feminism’. Consistent with ideas \nfrom queer theory, it seems that present and past oppression of women, \nor any group, is ultimately attributable to binary thinking, which \ninevitably grants priority to the privileged side of the relevant binary. \nThus, the concept of feminism is itself queer, in the sense of ‘questionable’ \nor ‘suspicious’, in that it reinforces the very problem it aims to resolve. \nRetaining ‘feminism’, however, reminds readers that, despite intentions \nto the contrary, the world just so happens to be structured in binary \nterms, and people assigned as female or feminine are often disadvantaged \nas a result. Until or unless the ‘feminism’ in ‘queer feminism’ is rendered \nmeaningless through major linguistic and conceptual transformation, the \n‘feminism’ in ‘queer feminism’ will remain relevant.\nEmerging Queer Feminist Practices\nRather than closing with a clearly articulated conclusion, I offer instead \na brief discussion of a few trends that are representative of what I take \nto be the spirit of queer feminism. In so doing, I hope that they might \nserve as inspiration for the ongoing development of queer feminism, \nnot merely as an academic exercise, but as part of the lived experience. \nThe examples I have selected are culture jamming, radical cheerleading, \nand zine making. My treatment of these topics is intentionally brief. My \nhope is that, following this quick introduction, at least some readers will \n",

Klein explains an example \nof a particularly successful instance of culture jamming:\nWell, there’s an upscale clothing company in London called \nBoxfresh. They decided to use images of the Zapatistas to sell \ntheir clothing. They put Subcommandante Marcos images in their \nwindows. Some local activists decided this was not cool, so they \ndressed up like Zapatistas and started leafleting. They eventually \ngot Boxfresh to agree to set up a computer terminal in the store \nwhere people could get information about who the Zapatistas \nactually are. They also got Boxfresh to agree to donate the profits \nfrom that particular line to the Zapatistas! \n(Quoted in Bullock, 2002)\nOther examples are available on the pages of any issue of the magazine \nAdbusters or at their website, which is subtitled the ‘Culturejammers \nHeadquarters’ (www.adbusters.org). Adbusters contains no advertising, \nthough it often features artistic reworkings of many of the same \nadvertising images featured on the pages of more mainstream magazines. \nNaomi Klein suggests that ‘feminists were some of the original culture \njammers’ (quoted in Bullock, 2002), and this is clear in the case of the \nGuerrilla Girls. Their website, subtitled ‘Fighting Discrimination with \nFacts, Humor and Fake Fur’ (www.guerrillagirls.com), describes their \nactivities:\nWe’re feminist masked avengers in the tradition of anonymous do-\ngooders like Robin Hood, Wonder Woman and Batman. How do \nwe expose sexism, racism and corruption in politics, art, film and \npop culture? With facts, humor and outrageous visuals. We reveal \nthe understory, the subtext, the overlooked, the and the downright \nunfair....In the last few years, we’ve unveiled anti-film industry \nbillboards in Hollywood just in time for the Oscars, and created \nlarge scale projects for the Venice Biennale, Istanbul and Mexico \nCity.

Radical cheerleading refers to groups of activists \nthat form squads or gather together on an ad hoc basis10 to engage in \npublic demonstrations or protests in connection with various social and \npolitical causes. Like traditional cheerleaders, radical cheerleaders often \nwear short skirts and shake pompoms to generate enthusiasm among \ntheir audience, but, unlike traditional cheerleaders, they also usually \ndisplay a decidedly counterculture aesthetic. Sample cheers are also \navailable online at radcheers.tripod.com, where they are organized into \nsuch categories as girl positive, environmental, queer, and sex positive \ncheers. Don’t Let the System Get You Down – Cheer Up! is a brief but \nentertaining and informative documentary by the New York City Radical \nCheerleaders (Nedbalsky and Christmas, 2004). Included in the bonus \nmaterial is a zine containing several cheers that can be printed out and \ndistributed.\nAs I explain elsewhere, zines11 are independent publications produced \noutside the commercial publishing process.12 This allows zine makers, or \nzinesters, the freedom to choose content that might not otherwise make \nit into print. Zines are an important outlet for feminist creative work and \npolitical expression, especially among third-wave feminists.\nIn many ways, third-wave feminism has emerged as a reaction \nby many younger feminists against the perceived rigidity and \nexclusivity of earlier forms of feminism. As such, it does not consist \nof a unified set of attitudes or beliefs. Thus, feminist zines, like the \npeople who create them, are as likely to celebrate the experiences \nof sex workers as they are to condemn the sex industry as a matter \nof principle; they are as likely to promote political activism as they \nare to denounce politics altogether; and they are as likely to feature \nsewing patterns, recipes, and fashion advice as they are to denigrate \ntraditional feminine roles. \n (Marinucci, 2006, p.375) \nCulture jamming, radical cheerleading, and zine making are just three \nexamples of queer feminist practice within popular culture.

Friedan is rumoured to have \nreferred to NOW’s lesbian membership as the ‘Lavender Menace’, a title that \nwas adopted as the name of a lesbian group that eventually formed to protest \ntheir exclusion from NOW and the mainstream feminist movement.\n2\t Consider, for example, that feminism has been critical of gay male drag \nperformance for its alleged mockery of ‘real’ women, and also of gay male \nsexual intimacy for its alleged promiscuity.\n3\t Consider that one of the most powerful expressions of bias against any \npopulation is to deny its very existence, and it is therefore significant that \nthere is almost no mention of bisexual women (or men, for that matter) in the \ncanonical feminist literature.\n4\t There is almost no mention of transgender women and men in the canonical \nfeminist literature. In fact, the most significant discussion of trans identity to \nemerge from the feminist movement centres on the exclusion of trans women \nfrom the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, as discussed in Chapter 5.\n5\t These problems have been documented quite thoroughly by many different \ntheorists. Particularly effective examples include Angela Davis (1981), Alice \nWalker (1983), and Patricia Hill Collins (1990).\n6\t For discussions at the intersection of queer theory and race theory, for example, \nrefer to Barnard (2004) and Ferguson (2004).

Frank Baum, The Road to Oz, p.196) \nThis section does not supply new material, but consists instead of \npassages collected from throughout the rest of the text. This section \nfunctions much like a glossary, because it contains passages that explain \nor otherwise comment on the usage of some abstract concepts and \ncontroversial terms associated with queer theory, feminism, and related \nsubject matter. Unlike a conventional glossary, however, it provides more \ncommentary and discussion than delineation and precision. Again unlike \na conventional glossary, which arranges entries alphabetically, this section \narranges the selected terms conceptually and chronologically, presenting \nthem in roughly the same order in which they appear throughout the \ntext. The advantage of this format is twofold. First, it positions each \nterm within the context in which it was used in the text, thus fostering \na more richly nuanced understanding of the featured concepts than is \nusually achieved through the use of decontextualized, dictionary-style \ndefinitions. Of course, those who prefer to access the relevant passages \ndirectly can always make use of the index at the back of the book. \nThe other advantage of this format is that, because the terms are listed \nchapter by chapter and section by section, this appendix can be useful \nfor reiterating the content of individual chapters and whole sections, or \nfor preparing to read individual chapters and whole sections apart from \nthe rest of the book. \n",

Because the essentialist \naccount regards homosexuality as an enduring feature of the human \ncondition, rather than the product of social contingencies, those who \naccept essentialism often assume that homosexuality is historically and \nculturally universal.\nEssentialism can be and has been applied to other identity categories as \nwell, such as those connected with concepts of gender and race. In a more \nabstract sense, essentialism dates at least as far back as the ancient Greek \nphilosopher Plato, who maintained that all general terms or categories \nreflect universal, eternal, pure, divine archetypes. Plato referred to these \narchetypes as Forms or Ideas, depending on the translation. This version \nof essentialism is usually contrasted with nominalism, according to which \nthe only thing that unites the disparate members of any category is the \ncontingent social fact that they happen to be given the same name. In \nresponse to Plato, for example, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle \nclaimed that reality is comprised of individuals, or tokens, rather than \nuniversals, or types.\nBinary\nBinary refers to a dualism or dualistic division, usually in service of \nsome form of essentialism.\nSocial Constructionism\nSome theorists who resist the popular assumption that the interests of \nlesbian women and gay men are best served by an essentialist perspective \non homosexuality instead suggest that the categories associated with \nsexual pleasure and desire are historical and cultural developments. \nThis thesis, often referred to as social constructionism, applies to \nheterosexual identity as well as alternative sexual identity categories, \nsuch as homosexual, lesbian, gay, and bisexual. This does not mean \nthat specific sexual acts are unique to the social contexts in which they \noccur. A wide range of physical interactions and bodily manipulations \nconnected with sexual desire or conducive to sexual pleasure occur across \ncultural and historical boundaries. The relationship of these interactions \nand manipulations to socially entrenched concepts of sexuality and \ncategories of sexual identity, however, is far from universal.\nSocial constructionism, like essentialism, can be and has been applied \nto other identity categories as well, such as those connected with concepts \n",

In a more general sense, social constructionism \nis the belief that reality, as known to humans, is a product of human \ninvention.\nSemantic Holism\nThomas Kuhn maintained that the terminology employed within the \nvarious sciences is part of an interwoven web of beliefs, such that the \nmeaning of any individual term is fully understood only by direct or \nindirect reference to the larger vocabulary and corresponding belief \nsystem. The indoctrination of scientists is largely a matter of language \nacquisition, and the language acquired determines standards of evidence \nand, hence, the range of empirical facts to be acknowledged and \nexplained. This characterization is sometimes referred to as semantic \nholism and contrasted with semantic atomism. \nSemantic Atomism\nWhereas holism explains the individual parts by reference to the greater \nwhole, atomism explains the whole by reference to its constituent parts. \nParadigm\nThe notion of a paradigm, as it is used here, is an extension of a \nconcept introduced and developed by Thomas Kuhn in reference to \nscientific practice. Kuhn maintained that the meaning of scientific terms \nis dependent on the overall framework, or paradigm, in which those \nterms occur. Kuhn also maintained that, just as the ambiguous image \nis consistent with more than one interpretive framework, it is often \nthe case that the empirical evidence is consistent with more than one \nparadigm.\nUnderdetermination\nAlthough it is not necessarily the case that every theory and every \nparadigm is consistent with the empirical evidence, it is often the case \nthat multiple theories and multiple paradigms are consistent with the \nempirical evidence. For this reason, evidence alone is often insufficient \nto determine the choice of one theory or one paradigm over another. To \nput it another way, theories and paradigms are often underdetermined.\nRelativism\nAccording to extreme versions of relativism, there is no relationship \nbetween reality and interpretation, and no distinction between fact and \nfiction. It is useful to differentiate between descriptive and prescriptive \nforms of relativism. While descriptive relativism amounts to the fairly \nuncontroversial notion that beliefs and practices vary from person to \nperson and from culture to culture, prescriptive relativism therefore \nconcludes that no meaningful distinction can be made between better \n",

Not every reference to relativism goes \nto the extreme of eliminating the distinction between fact and fiction, but \nthere is a prevalent concern that challenging notions of absolute truth \nand objective reality begins the descent down a slippery slope in that \ndirection.\nPederasty\nSexual relations between older and younger men, which were \ncommonplace in ancient Athens, are often referred to as pederasty. \nWhile pederasty refers, literally, to the love of boys, it is generally used \nto identify sexual relations between an adult male and a male who is \nyounger, but past the age of puberty. Pederasty is distinguished from \npedophilia, which refers to sexual relations between any adult and a \nprepubescent boy or girl.\nHijra\nThe term hijra is applied to those born male or intersex who undergo \nsurgical castration in order to dress as women and inhabit an intermediate \ngender role. \nIntersex\nIntersex refers to people who were born with biological characteristics \nthat do not differentiate them as clearly biologically female, nor as clearly \nbiologically male. In many cases, intersex people are subject to medical \nintervention shortly after birth to facilitate a closer match between their \nphysical presentation and a recognizably feminine or masculine gender \nidentity.\nHermaphrodite\nHistorically, the term hermaphrodite was used to refer to certain \nforms of what is now more commonly identified as intersex. The term \nhermaphrodite is potentially misleading if used to refer generically to all \nintesex bodies. It implies the presence of both male and female genitals, \nbut not all intersex bodies match this characterization. Although some \npeople prefer to be identified as hermaphrodites, more people prefer \nthe designation of intersex. Moreover, some regard hermaphrodite as \noutdated, insensitive, and even offensive.\nTransgender\nTransgender refers to people who were born as biological females but \nidentify internally, and often socially, as men, as well as people who \nwere born as biological males but identify internally, and often socially, \nas women. Some, but certainly not all, transgender men and women seek \nmedical intervention to facilitate a closer match between their physical \npresentation and the identity they experience internally. \n",

They often served as healers \nand performed sacred rituals. \n2: The Social History of Lesbian and Gay Identity\nSodomy\nToday, sodomy is often used to refer specifically to anal sex, but it also \nrefers more generally to any sexual intercourse other than when penis \nis received by vagina. Buggery, used primarily in England, has similar \nconnotations.\nDiscourse\nFoucault used the term discourse, not simply in reference to dialogue or \ndiscussion, but instead to refer more broadly to ‘ways of constituting \nknowledge, together with the social practices, forms of subjectivity and \npower relations which inhere in such knowledges and relations between \nthem’ (Weedon, 1987, p.108).\nSexual Inversion\nThe medical community did not acknowledge female homosexuality \nuntil late 19th- and early 20th-century sexologists addressed what they \nreferred to as ‘sexual inversion’, a condition believed to be characterized \nby the complete reversal of gender, including sexual attraction toward \nmembers of the same sex.

In particular, women who embody feminist \nprinciples are often characterized as lesbians. By equating feminist \nidentity with lesbian identity, lesbian-baiting is an attempt, often \nsuccessful, to capitalize on negative attitudes about homosexuality to \nprevent women from identifying as feminists.\n3: Queer Alternatives\nRevolutionary Practice\nThe term practice is used here, not in reference to repetition or rehearsal, \nbut rather to patterns of social behaviour and interaction. Karl Marx, \nfor example, described practice as ‘sensuous human activity’ (1970, \np.121) and remarked that ‘coincidence of the changing of circumstances \nand of human activity or self-changing can be conceived and rationally \nunderstood only as revolutionary practice’ (1970, p.121). \nParadigm Change\nJust as Marx made reference to revolutionary practice, Kuhn made \nreference to revolutionary science. For Kuhn, normal scientific practice, \ncharacterized by consensus around an established paradigm, is \ncontrasted with revolutionary scientific practice, characterized by crisis \nand conflict. \nA parallel exists between paradigm change, or revolution, in the \ncontext of scientific practice and paradigm change, or revolution, in the \nlarger context of political practice. In scientific practice and in political \npractice, crisis, along with a corresponding potential for revolution, \noccurs when the established paradigm ceases to accommodate the world \nit helped to create.\nIn the context of science, Kuhn noted, there ‘are always difficulties \nsomewhere in the paradigm-nature fit’, but these are usually resolved \nin the course of normal scientific practice (1970, p.82). The fit between \nparadigm and nature, or between theories and facts, is never perfect, and \nmuch of normal scientific practice consists of what Kuhn referred to as the \n‘mopping-up operations’ (1970, p.24) of extending and articulating the \naccepted paradigm. Not all messes are easily mopped up, however, and \nnot all mismatches between paradigm and nature are easily reconciled. \nWhen an especially stubborn mismatch between paradigm and nature \n",

These organizations upheld the rights of homosexuals by \nnoting the consensus within the medical community around the notion \nof homosexuality as a congenital condition (Jagose, 1996, p.22).\nThe Gay Liberation Movement\nSome resented the clinical connotations of the term homosexual along \nwith the apologetic attitude (Jagose, 1996, p.27) of the homophile \nmovement. Gay identity thus emerged as an alternative to homosexual \nidentity, and the gay liberation movement emerged as an alternative to \nthe homophile movement.\nAlthough it is an oversimplification, the Stonewall riots of 1969 \nare often cited as the beginning of the gay liberation movement. The \nStonewall Inn was a New York gay and drag bar, predominately Black and \nLatino, and it was subject, like many gay bars at the time, to occasional \npolice raids. These raids usually resulted in arrests for such forms of \n‘indecency’ as dancing, kissing, and cross dressing. When Stonewall was \nraided in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, however, the patrons \nfought back, and they continued fighting all weekend. This sudden and \nunanimous expression of outrage is sometimes attributed to the death of \ngay icon Judy Garland, whose funeral was held on 27 June 1969, but a \nmore likely explanation is that these riots, as well as the gay liberation \nmovement and other movements of the same era, including the women’s \nliberation movement and the Black civil rights movement, were evidence \nof a growing sense of injustice in response to discrimination.\nThe LGBT Movement\nAlthough gay can be used in reference to women as well as men, the \ngay liberation movement was concerned primarily with gay men, and \nmany lesbian women wanted the movement to recognize and include \nlesbian identity more explicitly. As a result of this demand, homosexual \nidentity is usually referred to in terms of both lesbian identity and gay \nmale identity.

In order to encompass a broader range of identities \nand issues, references to alternative sexualities were expanded to include \nbisexual identity. A drawback of this expanded terminology is that it \nis longer and somewhat more awkward than referring to gay, or even \ngay and lesbian, identities. For this reason, the abbreviation GLB was \nintroduced to refer to gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities. Recognizing \nthat women always seem to come second, some people preferred to \nrearrange the order the letters LGB, symbolically putting women ahead \nof men.\nThe recent addition of transgender identity completes a now familiar \nlist, GLBT or LGBT. Unlike lesbian, gay, and bisexual, the category of \ntransgender does not address sexual partner choice. Instead, it addresses \nthe discrepancy some people experience between the biological sex \ncategory to which they were assigned and their identification as women or \nmen. The inclusion of transgender people when accounting for alternative \nsexualities is not altogether arbitrary, however. Many who identify as \nlesbian, gay, or bisexual experience discrimination and violence for \ndeviating from the heterosexual norm, and this is also the case for those \nwho identify as transgender. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \nidentities all challenge the widespread expectation that biological females \nand biological males should exhibit the specific collection of attitudes \nand behaviours assigned to each sex category, and that they should \npartner sexually only with biological members of the opposite sex and \ncorresponding gender categories.\nGender\nAlthough the concepts of gender, sex, and sexuality are interrelated, it \nis often useful to differentiate among them.

This \nis part of the reason queer theory is notoriously difficult to define. In \nphilosophy, a successful definition is often understood as an articulation \nof the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the term to be \ndefined may be meaningfully and accurately applied. In other words, \nit draws an unproblematic boundary between the members of a given \ncategory and everything else, thereby participating in binary reasoning \nrather than transcending it. Queer theory, which trades essentialism \nand semantic atomism for social constructionism and semantic holism, \nrecognizes that meaning is conveyed not by definitions of individual \nterms but by contextual relations between and among various terms. \nAccording to Jagose, ‘Broadly speaking, queer describes those gestures \nor analytical models which dramatize incoherencies in the allegedly \nstable relations between chromosomal sex, gender and sexual desire’ \n(Jagose, 1996, p.3). Although this is not a definition in the customary \nsense, it is an informative description nonetheless. Those already familiar \nwith postmodernism might also benefit from the overly simplified but \npotentially explanatory description of queer theory as a postmodern \ninterpretation of gender, sex, and sexuality.\nSECTION II: SEX\n4: Unwelcome Interventions\nGenderfucking\nGiven that biological criteria for determining sex are not publicly \naccessible and secondary sex characteristics are not always reliable, it is \nremarkable that there is not more confusion when it comes to separating \npeople on the basis of sex. The ease with which most people can be \nrecognized as female or male has less to do with their biology than it has \nto do with various social markers. Although anyone, female or male, can \nwear a dress or a short hairstyle, such social displays are fairly reliable \nunless people consciously present themselves in an ambiguous manner, \nwhich is sometimes referred to informally as genderfucking\n \nThe Twins Case\nBruce Reimer, who was identified at birth as biologically male, was \n",

Initially, \nBrenda’s reassignment was believed to be so successful that the ‘twins \ncase’ was cited in many women’s studies textbooks as evidence of \ngender socialization.

As indicated in a promotional flyer from 1978, \nthe festival was conceived as ‘A Gathering of Mothers and Daughters \nfor Womyn-Born Womyn’ (Vogel, 2000). According to Linda Vogel, \n‘The hallmark of Michigan has always been its creation of separate, \nself-defined and deeply honored womyn’s space’ (Vogel, 2000). The \nfestival grounds, often referred to simply as ‘the land’, are designated \nexclusively for women, which reflects a commitment to the separatist \nagenda associated with some versions of radical feminism.\nWomyn\n‘Womyn’ is sometimes used instead of ‘women’ and ‘womon’ is used \ninstead of ‘woman’ as an alternative to the use of terminology that is \nreferential of men and masculinity.\nCamp Trans\nThe women-born-women requirement excluded trans women, and \noutrage over this exclusion led to the creation of Camp Trans.

It is worth noting that although many trans activists favour \nthe continued use of GID as a medical diagnosis, the many who do not are \nworking diligently in an effort to have it removed from the next updated \nedition of the DSM.

Although there is a \ngreat deal of variation from one theorist to the next, a common thread \nrunning through the different perspectives is the search for meaning in a \ncausally determined physical world.\nAlterity\nThe dominant group is defined by whom it excludes, and not merely \nby whom it includes. The identification of someone or something as \ndifferent from oneself is often referred to as alterity. \nThe Other\nAs an existentialist, Beauvoir was concerned about the tension between \nfreedom and determinism and believed that there is nothing necessary \nor inevitable about who a person ultimately becomes. Applied to the \ndistinction between women and men, this means that one must become \na woman in order to be a woman. The process of becoming a woman is \nintimately intertwined with the process by which someone is identified \nas or differentiated from a man. The male self is asserted as the subject, \nor the ‘One’ only by identifying the female as the object, or the ‘Other’.\nThis explanation of how people come to identify as women and men \nsuggests that these identity categories are contingent. To regard them as \ncontingent is to acknowledge that they could have been, and perhaps \ncould yet be, other than they are. By recognizing that ‘no subset of human \nbeings is destined by biology or a distinctive essence to being the absolute \nOther’ (Frye, 1996, p.994), Beauvoir anticipated what would eventually \nbe identified as the sex-gender distinction.\n",

In service of a deeply essentialist account of \ngender, sex, and sexuality, the hegemonic binary refers to the coalescence \nof gender, sex, and sexuality into exactly two fundamentally distinct \nnatural kinds: women and men. \nNatural Kinds\nThe traditional doctrine of natural kinds reflects an underlying \ncommitment to essentialism about the natural world. According to John \nDupré (1993), there are three conditions that must be met according to \nessentialist versions of the doctrine of natural kinds: first, natural kind \ncategories should be clearly and unambiguously delineated. Second, \nnatural kind categories should be a product of discovery rather than \ninvention or creation. Third, natural kind categories should reveal as \nmuch information as possible about the members of those categories – \nand, ideally, they will reveal all of the essential characteristics of those \nmembers (Dupré, 1993, pp.17–18). The traditional, essentialist, doctrine \nof natural kinds depicts an orderly world that divides into thoroughly \ninformative categories inclusive of all phenomena without leftovers or \ncrossovers.\nHilary Kornblith represents natural kinds as ‘homeostatic property \nclusters’ in which underlying structures produce the observable properties \nthat are distinctive of various natural kinds (Kornblith, 1993). Kornblith \nsuggests that experience reveals which properties and which sorts of \nproperties are indicative of relevant underlying structural differences.\nPlatonic Forms\nThe theory of the Forms is addressed in many of Plato’s works, but the \nallegory of the prisoners in the cave in Book VII of the The Republic \noffers a particularly vivid exposition (Plato, 1991, pp.253–61).

An analogy is drawn between these imperfect shadows and \nthe imperfection of the physical world. Just as physical objects are more \nreal and more perfect than mere shadows, so too are the Forms more \nreal and more perfect than any of the particular things encountered in \nthe everyday world. Unlike the particulars that populate the everyday \nworld, Forms are perfect, eternal, universal abstractions, much like \nthe concepts or categories of which the various particular things are \nmembers.\nPerformativity\nBorrowing from the example of drag performance, Butler indicates that, \nunlike the imitation of the Forms, the imitation that occurs in drag, or \nany other performance of gender, is an imitation that has no original. \nThere is not something real that gender imitates. What gender imitates \nis simply other performances of gender, which are themselves mere \nimitations. Butler remarks that ‘gender is a kind of imitation for which \nthere is no original; in fact, it is a kind of imitation that produces the \nvery notion of the original as an effect and consequence of the imitation \nitself’ (Butler, 1993, p.313).\nQueering\nInstead of attempting to repair the language and meaning surrounding \nexisting categories of gender, sex, and sexuality, there is also the option, as \nexpressed in the title of Butler’s 1990 book, of making ‘Gender Trouble’. \nMaking gender trouble simply means directing attention toward rather \nthan away from the limitations of existing categories, particularly the \nexisting categories of gender, sex, and sexuality associated with the \nhegemonic binary. Thus, rather than attempting to resolve the dispute \nregarding gender-neutral language and gender-inclusive language, a \nmeaningful third option is to use the problematic existing terminology, \nparticularly when doing so is most likely to emphasize mismatches \nwithin the categories of gender, sex, and sexuality associated with the \nhegemonic binary. This can also be characterized as a ‘queering’ of the \nestablished binaries. As explained by Anamarie Jagose, ‘queer’ refers \nto ‘those gestures or analytical models which dramatize incoherencies \nin the allegedly stable relations between chromosomal sex, gender and \nsexual desire’ (Jagose, 1996, p.3). To disrupt the hegemonic binary, \nperhaps even in very small ways, serves to ‘queer’ the paradigm. Making \n‘Gender Trouble’, rather than attempting to resolve or eliminate such \ntrouble, is thus a viable alternative for dealing with the existence of the \nsorts of incoherencies that Jagose seems to have in mind.\n",

According to liberal feminism, sexism is the product of bad \nreasoning, and the goal of feminism is to make the necessary corrections, \nparticularly within the legal system. \nWomanism\nAlice Walker articulated womanism as alternative to the white, \nsometimes even racist, orientation of mainstream feminism. Womanism \nshares with liberal feminism an interest in liberation strategies. The \ndifference, however, is that womanism, unlike liberal feminism, addresses \nintersectionality.\n \nIntersectionality\nIntersectionality refers to the simultaneous impact of race, gender, and \nclass on the lives of Black women (Davis, 1981; Crenshaw, 1994).\nMarxist Feminism\nDissatisfaction with liberal feminism invites an analysis of the structural \nconstraints contributing to the subordination of women, particularly \ncapitalism. Just as Marxism identifies capitalism as the source of \noppression, Marxist feminism (for example Reed, 1970) identifies \ncapitalism as the source of women’s oppression. On this account, the \nrole of women within contemporary western society is rooted not in \nbiology but in the rise of capitalism. From this perspective, the remedy \nis obvious. Although women have traditionally done most of the \ndomestic labour, this labour goes unacknowledged by a social system \nthat presupposed the economic dependence of women on men. Women \nneed power, which derives from economic leverage. Marxist feminism \ntherefore advocates the socialization of domestic labour or the more \nthorough integration of women into the wage labour system.\nRadical Feminism\nMarxist feminism has been criticized for reducing women’s oppression to \na subcategory of economic oppression. In a now famous analysis of rape, \nCatharine MacKinnon (1987) addresses the limitations of both liberal \nand Marxist approaches to feminism. On an economic model, rape is \nconstrued as an issue of property rights. Sex becomes rape only when it \noccurs as an act of wrongful possession between a man and a woman to \nwhom he is not sexually entitled. The legal distinction between rape and \nconsensual sex, according to MacKinnon, fosters this interpretation. It \nreinforces the role of men as those who seek a commodity, namely sex, \nthat is owned by women (or their fathers, husbands, brothers, and other \nprotectors). MacKinnon claims that, by differentiating between sex and \n",

For this reason, MacKinnon adopts radical \nfeminism and advocates voluntary lesbianism as an alternative to the \npower symmetry inherent in heterosexual relationships.\nAdrienne Rich also advocates voluntary lesbianism, which is used \nalmost interchangeably with woman-identification, as an alternative to \nthe oppressive system that enforces the heterosexual norm. While not \nall radical feminists oppose heterosexuality, they do tend to agree that \nit is historically and socially problematic (for example Bunch, 1975; \nRich, 1980). This is because heterosexual relationships often perpetuate \npatriarchy. Various articulations of radical feminism are unified by their \nmutual critique of patriarchy as the fundamental source of sexism.\nPatriarchy\nPatriarchy is best characterized as a social structure that grants priority to \nthat which is male or masculine over that which is female or feminine. \nSocialist Feminism\nSocialist feminism emerges as something of a synthesis of Marxist \nand radical feminisms. Socialist feminism opposes the primacy of \nclass in Marxist analyses and of sex in radical analyses, and instead \nregards capitalism and male sexual dominance as equal partners \nin the subordination of women (for example Hartmann, 1981). For \nthis reason, it is believed that socialist reform is necessary, but that \nreform efforts will be adequate only if they address the often hidden \nfemale half of the labour force. According to socialist feminism, lower \nclasses of men are simultaneously privileged and disadvantaged. They \npossess power in relation to women, but they lack power in the larger \nsocial context. Since men have no immediate or obvious interest in \nrelinquishing power over women, socialist reform will be insufficient \nunless it is also feminist.\nMulticultural Feminism\nMulticultural and global feminisms both exhibit interest in, and respect \nfor, the lived experiences of women who are outside the dominant white \nculture. Multicultural feminism (for example Collins, 1990; Anzaldua, \n1987), also sometimes referred to as ‘women of color feminism’, \naddresses the unique issues that racial and ethnic minority women \nexperience as a result of the intersecting influences of gender, race, class, \nand sexuality on cultural identities.\nGlobal Feminism\nMulticultural and global feminisms both exhibit interest in, and respect \nfor, the lived experiences of women who are outside the mainstream \nculture of white Americans and Europeans.

In particular, global feminism \nexamines the impact of imperialism and colonialism, thereby bringing \ninternational politics to the analysis of women’s issues. Consider, for \ninstance, Cynthia Enloe’s (1995) influential article ‘The Globetrotting \nSneaker’, which exposed the impact on people in general, but particularly \non women and their children, when multinational corporations like Nike \nexploit the workers and natural resources in vulnerable parts of the \nworld. \nFeminist Ethics\nFeminist theory refers to theorizing that addresses feminist questions \nand concerns. A closely related sort of theorizing that is also relevant \nto the present discussion is feminist philosophy, whereby a feminist \nperspective, attitude, or orientation is applied to philosophical questions \nand concerns. An example is feminist ethics, in which a feminist \nperspective is applied to the study of morality. \nEthics of Care\nIn the early 1980s, research by Carol Gilligan (1982), Nel Noddings \n(1984), and others suggested that girls and women may be disposed \ntoward a different style of ethical reasoning than boys and men. \nSpecifically, they suggested that ethics based on the natural impulse to \ncare for others provides a feminine and feminist alternative to more \nfamiliar systems of ethics that are based on notions of justice. The ethics \nof care offers an alternative account in which morality is situated in \nrelationships as a whole, rather than in discreet choices and actions or \nthe moral rules that govern those choices and actions.\nEcofeminism\nEcofeminism resists the temptation to supply universal moral rules, and \nis directed instead toward revealing and addressing what Karen Warren \n(2000) refers to as ‘the logic of domination’ in the relationships between \npeople or groups of people, and also in the relationships between people \nor groups of people and other parts of the natural world. The ecofeminist \ncritique of the logic of domination is ultimately a critique of the western \nphilosophical tradition, which has devoted itself to establishing the \nsuperiority of reason, and hence of humankind, in the specific form of \nmankind, over everything else.\nFeminist Epistemology\nFeminist theory refers to theorizing that addresses feminist questions \nand concerns.

An example is feminist epistemology, in which a feminist \nperspective is applied to the study of knowledge. \nLogical Empiricism\nLogical empiricism, sometimes referred to as logical positivism, describes \nthe union of positivism, or empiricism, and logic. Positivism is the \nbelief that statements are meaningful only if they are verifiable through \nexperience. Logic is a system for analysing the formal relationships \nbetween and among statements. Logical empiricism thus refers to an \naccount whereby knowledge, especially scientific knowledge, is produced \nwhen empirically verifiable data, in the form of observation statements, \nare subjected to logical analysis in order to confirm or disconfirm a \nrange of theories and hypotheses. This account presupposes that it is \nboth possible and desirable for scientists and other epistemic agents to \nbe neutral in the collection and evaluation of data, such that a given \nepistemic agent is, or at least should be, virtually interchangeable with \nany other epistemic agent.\nFeminist Empiricism\nFeminist empiricism shares with logical empiricism a commitment to \nscientific neutrality, but denies that sexism and other forms of bias are \neasily avoided. Feminist empiricists have exposed numerous cases in \nwhich predominantly male scientific communities have misrepresented \nor ignored women and, as result, have generated faulty conclusions. \nFor instance, the exclusive use of male subjects in experiments intended \nfor generalization to the larger human population is no longer deemed \nacceptable, largely because feminist empiricists have revealed the \nhidden biases of this practice. Indeed, the ethics of care emerged as an \nalternative traditional ethics precisely because feminist research on moral \ndevelopment in children revealed that earlier work had concentrated \nalmost exclusively on boys. According to feminist empiricism, sexist \nscience occurs when scientists fail to reason as carefully and neutrally as \nthey should. Thus, the role of feminist empiricism is largely corrective.\nFeminist Standpoint Theory\nStandpoint theory borrows from Marxism the suggestion that those \nliving under conditions of domination have a more complete perspective \nthan their oppressors (Smith, 1987, pp.78–88). On this account, \nepistemic communities consist of a dominant group, or centre, and \na dominated group, or margin. From the margin, someone gains an \noutsider’s perspective on the centre, and is thereby better equipped to \nexpose the limitations of the dominant ideology.\nLike feminist empiricism, the role of standpoint theory is largely \ncorrective.

Unlike \nfeminist empiricism, however, standpoint theory indicates that the \ncorrective, privileged perspective can be achieved only from the social \nmargins (hooks, 2000).\nModernism\nIn everyday usage, modern refers literally to whatever is new, whatever \nis happening at the current moment. In its more technical usage, \nmodernism refers to specific eras and schools of thought within a variety \nof different domains, such as philosophy, science studies, art history, \nliterary criticism, film theory, and so on. What modernism means for \nscience studies, for example, may have very little in common with what \nit means for art history or any other field. Addressing very briefly its \nusage in philosophy, the modern era began around the beginning of the \n17th century, against the historical backdrop of the scientific revolution, \nand lasted into the beginning of the 19th century, in the context of the \nEnlightenment. The Enlightenment is perhaps best described as a general \nattitude of celebration and optimism about the potential use of reason to \nobtain truth and achieve the highest human potential. \nPostmodernism\nPostmodernism leaves behind the optimism associated with modernism \nand the Enlightenment. For postmodernism in general, and for \npostmodern feminism in particular, there is no absolute truth. Any \nattempt to distinguish fact from fiction is thus a political project, based \nas much in ideology and values as it is in evidence and logic. \nPostmodern Feminism\nLike standpoint theories, postmodern feminism acknowledges that social \npositioning influences epistemological perspective. For postmodern \nfeminism, in which postmodernism is applied to the subject matter of \nfeminism, this means that there is no underlying truth about sex or \ngender. In a particularly provocative statement of this position, Judith \nButler has suggested not just that gender is socially constructed, but \nthat sex itself is also socially constructed. Sex, Butler claims, ‘is an ideal \nconstruct which is forcibly materialized through time. It is not a simple \nfact or static condition of a body, but a process whereby regulatory \nnorms materialize “sex” and achieve this materialization through a \nforcible reiteration of those norms’ (Butler, 1993, pp.1–2).\nThird-Wave Feminism\nThird-wave feminism describes the newest generations of feminists at a \ntime in history when many have suggested that, at least for women in \nmost of Europe and North America, feminism is no longer necessary. In \nfact, when Rebecca Walker first made reference to the ‘third-wave’ in \n",

While some challenge the notion of third-wave feminism \nby suggesting that the second wave was so successful that sexism is no \nlonger a significant problem, others challenge the notion of third-wave \nfeminism by suggesting that the second wave has not yet completed its \nwork.\nThird-wave feminism is not easily defined, partly because it is still in \nthe process of establishing itself, and partly because one of the features \ncommon across different articulations of third-wave feminism is its \nrecognition that there are multiple versions of what it means to be a \nfeminist, or even a third-wave feminism. \nSECTION IV: QUEER FEMINISM\n8: Notes Toward a Queer Feminism\nQueer Feminism\nQueer feminism is simply the application of queer notions of gender, \nsex, and sexuality to the subject matter of feminist theory, and the \nsimultaneous application of feminist notions of gender, sex, and \nsexuality to the subject matter of queer theory. Although the word queer \nis commonly associated with sex and sexuality, queer theory is a way of \nunderstanding not just sex and sexuality but also gender. Specifically, \nqueer theory avoids the binary and hierarchical reasoning usually \nassociated with these concepts. Precisely what it is that constitutes the \nsubject matter of feminism varies from one form of feminism to the next. \nDespite this diversity, however, almost every form of feminism addresses \nat least gender and sex, and sometimes sexuality as well. There is thus an \nimplicit connection between queer theory and feminist theory, and queer \nfeminism makes this connection more explicit. \nQueer feminism brings both a queer orientation to feminist theory, \nand a feminist orientation to queer theory. Part of what makes the union \nof queer and feminist theory so inviting is that they already have much \nin common. Both address the intersecting issues of gender, sex, and \nsexuality. In the case of queer theory, however, the emphasis is on sex \nand sexuality. In the case of feminist theory, the emphasis is on gender \nand sex. An obvious outcome of uniting queer and feminist theory, then, \nis that the addition of a queer perspective promises to direct increased \nattention toward sexuality in the context of feminist theory, while the \naddition of a feminist perspective promises to direct increased attention \nto gender in the context of queer theory.\n",

    "chunk_full": "For a long time, the story goes, we supported a Victorian \nregime, and we continue to be dominated by it even today. \nThus the image of the imperial prude is emblazoned on our \nrestrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality. \nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century a certain \nfrankness was still common, it would seem. Sexual practices \nhad little need of secrecy; words were said without undue \nreticence, and things were done without too much conceal- \nment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit. Codes \nregulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were \nquite lax compared to those of the nineteenth century. It was \na time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open \ntransgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermin- \ngled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the \nlaughter of adults: it was a period when bodies \"made a \ndisplay of themselves.\" \nBut twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the \nmonotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie. Sexuality \nwas carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal \nfamily took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious \nfunction of reproduction. On the subject of sex, silence be- \ncame the rule. The legitimate and procreative couple laid \ndown the law. The couple imposed itself as model, enforced \nthe norm, safeguarded the truth, and reserved the right to \nspeak while retaining the principle of secrecy. A single locus \nof sexuality was acknowledged in social space as well as at \nthe heart of every household, but it was a utilitarian and \nfertile one: the parents' bedroom. The rest had only to re- \nmain vague; proper demeanor avoided contact with other \nbodies, and verbal decency sanitized one's speech. And ster- \n3 \n",

    "chunk_full": "The History of Sexuality \nile behavior carried the taint of abnormality; if it insisted on \nmaking itself too visible, it would be designated accordingly \nand would have to pay the penalty. \nNothing that was not ordered in terms of generation or \ntransfigured by it could expect sanction or protection. Nor \ndid it merit a hearing. It would be driven out, denied, and \nreduced to silence. Not only did it not exist, it had no right \nto exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani- \nfestation-whether \nin acts or in words. Everyone knew, for \nexample, that children had no sex, which was why they were \nforbidden to talk about it, why one closed one's eyes and \nstopped one's ears whenever they came to show evidence to \nthe contrary, and why a general and studied silence was \nimposed. These are the characteristic features attributed to \nrepression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi- \ntions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen- \ntence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an \naffirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis- \nsion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing \ntosee, and nothing to know. Such was the hypocrisy of our \nbourgeois societies with its halting logic. It was forced to \nmake a few concessions, however.

A third and final doubt: Did \nthe critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come \nto act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had ope- \nrated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part \nof the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and \ndoubtless misrepresents) by calling it \"repression\"?

The Middle Ages had organized around \nthe theme of the flesh and the practice of penance a discourse \nthat was markedly unitary. In the course of recent centuries, \nthis relative uniformity was broken apart, scattered, and \nmultiplied in an explosion of distinct discursivities which \ntook form in demography, biology, medicine, psychiatry, \npsychology, ethics, pedagogy, and political criticism. More \nprecisely, the secure bond that held together the moral theol- \nogy of concupiscence and the obligation of confession (equiv- \nalent to the theoretical discourse on sex and its first-person \nformulation) was, if not broken, at least loosened and diver- \nsified: between the objectification of sex in rational dis- \ncourses, and the movement by which each individual was set \n",

Not because, hav- \ning tried to erect too rigid or too general a barr*raagainst \nsexuality, society succeeded only in giving rise to a whole \nperverse outbreak and a long pathology of the sexual instinct. \nAt issue, rather, is the type of power it 6rought to bear on \nthe body and on sex. In point of fact, this power had neither \nthe form of the law, nor the effects of the taboo. On the \ncontrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities. It \ndid not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various \nforms of sexuality, pursuing them according to lines of indefi- \nnite penetration. It did not exclude sexuality, but included it \nin the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It did \nnot seek to avoid it; it attracted its varieties by means of \nspirals in which pleasure and power reinforced one another. \nIt did not set up a barrier; it provided places of maximum \nsaturation. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic. \nModern society is perverse, not in spite of its puritanism or \nas if from a backlash provoked by its hypocrisy; it is in actual \nfact, and directly, perverse. \nIn actual fact.

The interplay of incitement and elision is clearly \nevident in them. A handwritten note gives an account of the session of November \n25, 1877.

He with- \ndraws the baton, and there is a fresh attack, which he accelerates by administering \ninhalations of amyl nitrate.

One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not \nan institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain \nstrength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attrib- \nutes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society. \nShould we turn the expression around, then, and say that \npolitics is war pursued by other means? If we still wish to \nmaintain a separation between war and politics, perhaps we \nshould postulate rather that this multiplicity of force rela- \ntions can be coded-in \npart but never totally-either in the \nform of \"war,\" or in the form of \"politics\"; this would imply \ntwo different strategies (but the one always liable to switch \ninto the other) for integrating these unbalanced, heterogene- \nous, unstable, and tense force relations. \n",

But these are not intended as methodological \nimperatives; at most they are cautionary prescriptions. \n1. Rule of immanence \nOne must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of \nsexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and \ndisinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mech- \nanisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or \nideological requirements of power. If sexuality was con- \nstituted as an area of investigation, this was only because \nrelations of power had established it as a possible object; and \nconversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was \nbecause techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis- \ncourse were capable of investing it. Between techniques of \nknowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, \neven if they have specific roles and are linked together on the \nbasis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what \nmight be called \"local centers\" of power-knowledge: for ex- \nample, the relations that obtain between penitents and \nconfessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience. \nHere, guided by the theme of the \"flesh\" that must be mas- \ntered, different forms of discourse-self-examination, \nques- \ntioning~, admissions, interpretations, interviews-were \nthe \nvehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of \nforms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge. Similarly, \nthe body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his \ncradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of \nparents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten- \ntive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted, \nparticularly since the eighteenth century, another \"local cen- \nter\" of power-knowledge. \n",

We are compelled, then, to accept three or four hypoth- \neses which run counter to the one on which the theme of a \nsexuality repressed by the modern forms of society is based: \nsexuality is tied to recent devices of power; it has been ex- \npanding at an increasing rate since the seventeenth century; \nthe arrangement that has sustained it is not governed by \nreproduction; it has been linked from the outset with an \nintensification of the body-with \nits exploitation as an object \nof knowledge and an element in relations of power. \nIt is not exact to say that the deployment of sexuality \nsupplanted the deployment of alliance. One can imagine that \none day it will have replaced it. But as things stand at pre- \nsent, while it does tend to cover up the deployment of alli- \nance, it has neither obliterated the latter nor rendered it \nuseless. Moreover, historically it was around and on the basis \nof the deployment of alliance that the deployment of sexual- \nity was constructed. First the practice of penance, then that \nof the examination of conscience and spiritual direction, was \nthe formative nucleus: as we have seen,' what was at issue to \nbegin with at the tribunal of penance was sex insofar as it was \nthe basis of relations; the questions posed had to do with the \ncommerce allowed or forbidden (adultery, extramarital rela- \ntions, relations with a person prohibited by blood or statute, \nthe legitimate or illegitimate character of the act of sexual \n' Cf page 37 above. \n",

Then these \nnew personages made their appearance: the nervous woman, \nthe frigid wife, the indifferent mother--or worse, the mother \nbeset by murderous obsessions-the \nimpotent, sadistic, \nperverse husband, the hysterical or neurasthenic girl, the \nprecocious and already exhausted child, and the young \nhomosexual who rejects marriage or neglects his wife. These \nwere the combined figures of an alliance gone bad and an \nabnormal sexuality; they were the means by which the dis- \nturbing factors of the latter were brought into the former; \n* Molikre's Tartufe and Jakob Michael Lenz's Tutor, separated by more than a \ncentury, both depict the interference of the deployment of sexuality in the famiIy \norganization, apropos of spiritual direction in TartuJFe and education in The Tutor. \n",

On the con- \ntrary, the most rigorous techniques were formed and, more \nparticularly, applied first, with the greatest intensity, in the \neconomically privileged and politically dominant classes. \nThe direction of consciences, self-examination, the entire \nlong elaboration of the transgressions of the flesh, and the \nscrupulous detection of concupiscence were all subtle proce- \ndures that could only have been accessible to small groups \nof people. It is true that the penitential method of Alfonso \nde' Liguori and the rules recommended to the Methodists by \nWesley ensured that these procedures would be more widely \ndisseminated, after a fashion; but this was at 'the cost of a \nconsiderable simplification. \nThe same can be said of the family as an agency of control \nand a point of sexual saturation: it was in the \"bourgeois\" or \n\"aristocratic\" family that the sexuality of children and \nadolescents was first problematized, and feminine sexuality \nmedicalized; it was the first to be alerted to the potential \npathology of sex, the urgent need to keep it under close \nwatch and to devise a rational technology of correction. It \nwas this family that first became a locus for the psychiatriza- \ntion of sex. Surrendering to fears, creating remedies, appeal- \ning for rescue by learned techniques, generating countless \ndiscourses, it was the first to commit itself to sexual erethism. \nThe bourgeoisie began by considering that its own sex was \n",

Power in this instance was \nessentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and \nultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize \nhold of life in order to suppress it. \nSince the classical age the West has undergone a very \nprofound transformation of these mechanisms of power. \n\"Deduction\" has tended to be no longer the major form of \npower but merely one element among others, working to \nincite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize \nthe forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak- \ning them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated \nto impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. \nThere has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least \na tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis- \ntering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that \nwas based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as \nsimply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, \nmaintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody \nas they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things \n\"Just as a composite body can have properties not found in any of the simple bodies \nof which the mixture consists, so a moral body, by virtue of the very union of \npersons of which it is composed, can have certain rights which none of the individu- \nals could expressly claim and whose exercise is the proper function of leaders \nalone.\" Pufendorf, Le Droit de la nature, p. 452. \n",

Hysteria was \ninterpreted in this strategy as the movement of sex insofar as \nit was the \"one\" and the \"other,\" whole and part, principle \nand lack. In the sexualization of childhood, there was formed \nthe idea of a sex that was both present (from the evidence of \nanatomy) and absent (from the standpoint of physiology), \npresent too if one considered its activity, and deficient if one \nreferred to its reproductive finality; or again, actual in its \nmanifestations, but hidden in its eventual effects, whose path- \nological seriousness would only become apparent later. If the \nsex of the child was still present in the adult, it was in the \nform of a secret causality that tended to nullify the sex of the \nlatter (it was one of the tenets of eighteenth- and nineteenth- \ncentury medicine that precocious sex would eventually result \nin sterility, impotence, frigidity, the inability to experience \npleasure, or the deadening of the senses); by sexualizing \nchildhood, the idea was established of a sex characterized \nessentially by the interplay of presence and absence, the visi- \nble and the hidden; masturbation and the effects imputed to \nit were thought to reveal in a privileged way this interplay \nof presence and absence, of the visible and the hidden. \nIn the psychiatrization of perversions, sex was related to \nbiological functions and to an anatomo-physiological ma- \nchinery that gave it its \"meaning,\" that is, its finality; but it \nwas also referred to an instinct which, through its peculiar \ndevelopment and according to the objects to which it could \nbecome attached, made it possible for perverse behavior pat- \nterns to arise and made their genesis intelligible.

In it one could clearly perceive the way \nin which the instinct became fastened to an object in accord- \nance with an individual's historical adherence and biological \ninadequacy. Lastly, in the socialization of procreative behav- \nior, \"sex\" was described as being caught between a law of \n, reality (economic necessity being its most' abrupt and imme- \ndiate form) and an economy of pleasure which was always \nattempting to circumvent that law-when, \nthat is, it did not \nignore it altogether. The most notorious of \"frauds,\" coitus \ninterruptus, represented the point where the insistence of the \nreal forced an end to pleasure and where the pleasure found \na way to surface despite the economy dictated by the real. It \nis apparent that the deployment of sexuality, with its differ- \nent strategies, was what established this notion of \"sex\"; and \nin the four major forms of hysteria, onanism, fetishism, and \ninterrupted coition, it showed this sex to be governed by the \ninterplay of whole and part, principle and lack, absence and \npresence, excess and deficiency, by the function of instinct, \nfinality, and meaning, of reality and pleasure. \nThe theory thus generated performed a certain number of \nfunctions that made it indispensable. First, the notion of \n\"sex\" made it possible to group together, in an artificial \n' unity, anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts, \nsensations, and pleasures, and it enabled one to make use of \nthis fictitious unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent \nmeaning, a secret to be discovered everywhere: sex was thus \nable to function as a unique signifier and as a universal \nsignified.

While Michel Foucault’s work on \nbiopolitics is a particularly celebrated example, his innovations \noccurred in parallel with another endeavor, initiated independently \nof him: The practical and theoretical eﬀorts of autonomist \nfeminists, ﬁrst in Italy. Beginning with a new approach to the study \nof domestic labor and the nature of the value that it produces, these \nthinkers developed increasingly far-reaching approaches to \nproblems of racism, colonial and post-colonial subjugation, and \necological despoliation, as well as the subordination of women. \nAnticipating a series of other developments in feminism and queer \ntheory, the autonomist feminists – Mariarosa Dalla Costa, \nLeopoldina Fortunati, Maria Mies, and Silvia Federici, among \nothers – developed sophisticated formulations of compulsory \nheterosexuality, sexual commodiﬁcation, rape culture, and the \nreciprocal bonds between class and gender. Moreover, the \nstructural and even totalizing approach that these authors \nproduced has a great deal to oﬀer us today, because it carefully \nelaborates a common horizon of struggle on which solidarity can be \nbuilt.\nFederici’s Critique of Foucault\nFoucault’s work in the 1970s, beginning with Discipline and Punish \nand the lectures that preceded it, Psychiatric Power, initiates a \ndistinct and inﬂuential research program. Raising the question of \nthe management and control of life processes, by an array of \nstrategies of power and knowledge, he demonstrates a ﬁne-tuned \nand sensitive method for uncovering and registering the process \nthat produce subjects. Each of these subjects, among other \nattributes, are allocated a particular sexuality that is reciprocally \nproduced and incited by institutions, as well as individual and \ncollective resistances to these modes of control. However, \ncommentators have identiﬁed certain blind spots in his approach. \nFor example, while sexuality is a topic of inquiry for him, he is \nlargely inattentive to the speciﬁcs of gender. Further, his account \ncan seem to imply a kind of ﬁxity that some readers ﬁnd paralyzing; \nthe lack of an outside to power and knowledge makes resistance a \nconcomitant element of control, and it can be diﬀicult to determine \nthe possibilities of struggle for a more just world, on the basis of \nFoucault’s analysis.\nFoucault initially developed his insight under the name “biopower.” \nBiopower is the name for the administration of “man in so far as he \nis a living being”; for example, rather than fundamental concern \nwith beliefs, taxation, public participation, technological \ndevelopment, or class domination, the state begins to see a \nfundamental interest as controlling birthrates and identifying \npotential illnesses (“Society Must Be Defended” 240). Biopower is \nintrinsically an interaction between state policy and the conditions \nof human life. In his later work, Foucault declares that in the \nmodern period, the human being had transformed from “a living \nanimal with the additional capacity for a political existence” to “an \nanimal whose politics places his existence as a living being in \nquestion” (History of Sexuality 143). This radicalization of the \napproach to biopower marks an inversion of priority, according to \nwhich life is not a prior given that must be managed, but rather \nthat political techniques have priority over biological processes \nthemselves. Subsequently, a substantial literature has developed, \ndevoted to questions of analyses of the biopolitics of the \ncontemporary period, as well as its genealogy.\nIn a footnote to Discipline and Punish, Foucault writes that while he \nhas chosen particular examples in order to illustrate biopolitics, \nothers “might have been taken from colonization, slavery and child \nrearing” (314). It is not clear whether he feels that these \nphenomena simply obey the same principles that he has \ndemonstrated in his own studies, or whether they would require \nentirely new concepts and modes of inquiry. I suggest that \nautonomist feminists, independently of Foucault, contributed a \nbiopolitical study of reproductive labor (including child rearing) \nthat also serves to illuminate the relations of power and domination \nthat undergird colonization. In other words, these authors might be \nread as a long elaboration and contestation of this footnote, to the \ndegree that their own studies might pre-empt Foucault’s, as \ndescriptions of the most salient forms of biopower.\nIn the introduction to her groundbreaking study of 2004, Caliban \nand the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation, Silvia \nFederici makes a number of trenchant criticisms of Foucault. While \nstrongly indebted to his understanding of biopolitics, Federici \nconfronts it with insights from the Marxist, feminist, and \ndecolonizing traditions (12). Federici argues, ﬁrst, that the feminist \ntradition had already developed a study of biopolitics avant la lettre \n(15). Further, Federici emphasizes the continuing brutality of the \ntreatment of women and racialized populations. While Foucault \ncertainly viewed biopolitics as including the possibility of state-\nadministered harm and death, he argues that the modern period \nwas generally marked by a decline in direct assaults on the body. \nHe believed that modern society had transitioned from one that \nfocused on sanguinity (breeding and physical vulnerability) to a \nperiod in which it prioritized sexuality (desires as carrying \npsychological weight beyond their physical enactment) (History of \nSexuality I, 150).\nFederici argues that Foucault’s claim that physical violence \ndeclined as a mode of control is only an eﬀect of a relatively myopic \npoint of view; in making this claim, he neglects the brutal violence \nmeted out to women and to the targets of racism (16).

Further, she ties the \nprocess of control, punishment, violation and execution of women’s \nbodies to colonial means of domination and imposition of capitalist \nproductive forces (133−162). Drawing on Karl Marx’s insights, \nFederici develops the concept of primitive accumulation as the \nname for these violent, coercive and scarifying practices, the \nensemble of which have given us modernity.\nMarx’s Primitive Accumulation\nMarx develops the concept of primitive accumulation in the ﬁnal \nchapters of the ﬁrst volume of Capital, and the notebooks entitled \n“Precapitalist Economic Formations” in the Grundrisse (Read 20). \nThe idea develops from a basic problem; as Jason Read summarizes \nit, \nTo accumulate capital it is necessary to possess capital. There must \nthen be an original or previous accumulation, one that is not the \nresult of the capitalist mode of production but rather its point of \ndeparture and that constitutes the originary diﬀerentiation between \ncapital and workers (21).\nMarx argues that there is a conventional moral explanation—some \npeople save while others squander—but this is an ahistorical myth. \nIn his description, capitalism requires contact between two very \ndiﬀerent kinds of commodity owners; on the one hand, the owners \nof money, means of production means of subsistence, who are eager \nto valorize the sum of values they have appropriated by buying the \nlabor-power of others; on the other hand, free workers, the sellers \nof ‘their’ own labor-power, and therefore the sellers of labor (Marx \n874).\nRather than human nature, the development of capitalism rests on \nan artiﬁcial construction of social relations. In order to produce this \nnew relation of production, Marx argues that capitalism must enact \nthe “extinction of a whole series of older formations of social \nproduction” (273). By this means, capitalism begins in violence \nrather than free association. Further, in the Grundrisse, Marx \nwrites that “The propertyless are more inclined to become \nvagabonds and robbers and beggars than workers” (notebook VII). \nFor this reason, dispossession must be followed by penalization; a \nwhole set of coercive measures must continually be exerted so that \nthe population will form a pliable working class. While Marx \nsometimes presents primitive accumulation as relegated to the \ndistant past, he also links it to ongoing processes of colonization. \nFor this reason, many Marxists argue that primitive accumulation is \nan ongoing feature of capitalist modernity. Certain contemporary \nautonomists have come to view the process of primitive \naccumulation broadly as a series of processes and strategies that \nproduce a speciﬁc type of contemporary subject, capable of \nproducing and consuming, and ﬁtted with a variety of fears and \nhopes.\nRead, then, deﬁnes contemporary primitive accumulation as “the \nmanner in which a mode of production is constitutive and \nconstituted by desires, forms of living, and intentions: subjectivity” \n(26). From a traditional perspective, the theory of biopolitics is \nsomewhat at odds with Marxist analysis, because Marx’s thesis is \nthat capitalist society is fundamentally engineered to produce \nsurplus value; administration of life processes is secondary to this\neconomic goal. However, when primitive accumulation describes all \nof the processes of disciplining human potential and action for the \nmost eﬀicient exploitation by capital, it begins to function as \nanother name for the biopolitics described by Foucault.\nFederici developed a feminist approach to primitive accumulation \nthat draws on Marx’s and Foucault’s descriptions as well as \ncriticizing them. According to Federici, primitive accumulation does \nnot create the proletariat as a homogeneous whole; rather, it also \nintroduces various racialized and gendered hierarchies (63−64). \nThese instrumentalized identities rests on procedures of \ndisciplining the body; she says, “the human body and not the steam \nengine, and not even the clock, was the ﬁrst machine developed by \ncapitalism” (146). In her description, primitive accumulation \nincludes “the mechanization of the proletarian body and its \ntransformation, in the case of women, into a machine for the \nproduction of new workers” (12). Federici also argues that a \nfundamental violence remains an ongoing part of the process, \naccording to which force, pain and death are necessary in order to \neliminate non-productive elements of the populace. These insights \ndraw on a serious of prior studies produced in the autonomist-\nfeminist tradition, including the work of a German author, Maria \nMies.\nMies’ Global Primitive Accumulation and Ecofeminism\nPatriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale, written by Maria \nMies in 1986, builds on the perspectives of Italian autonomist \nfeminists while introducing a series of signiﬁcant departures and \nimplicit challenges. Unlike her predecessors, who emerged from \nthe Italian struggles during the “Years of Lead,” Mies is a German \nscholar and activist whose formative work was conducted in India. \nWhile the redeﬁnition of reproductive labor is fundamental to her \neﬀort, Mies develops a global and historical approach that aims to \ncompletely re-characterize capitalism itself. By investigating \nanthropological data, she establishes a perspective closer to radical \nfeminism; while capital accumulation, in her view, is the \nfundamental cause of the exploitation of women, the beginnings of \nthis process of accumulation are themselves bound to a masculine \nworldview and a pre-historical victory of men over women. Also, \nwhile her predecessors often argued that capitalism presents a new \nhorizon of possibility as well as deepening and expanding \nexploitation, Mies rejects the positive dimension of capitalist \ngrowth. The Italian autonomists tended to view automation, as well \nas political struggle, as a necessary route to liberation from \nhousework; in stark contrast, Mies rejects technological solutions \nand argues for a return to a subsistence perspective (220). While \nthe Italians strenuously insisted on a purely working-class \nviewpoint, she argues that a global middle-class feminist movement \nis necessary in order to begin the social changes that could begin a \nreal transformation (206). Last, while the Italians subscribed to a \nMarxist conception of revolution that would expropriate the \nbourgeoisie, Mies rejects violence as “mid-wife of history” and \ninstead proposes a movement of consumer boycotts (5). While Mies \ndraws on Marx’s analyses, her perspective exits revolutionary \nMarxism, towards a feminist anarchism (37).\nMies argues that the contemporary world system depends on the \n“subordination and exploitation of women, nature and colonies” (2). \nAll three of these forms of domination involve a seizure of the\n",

Like Fortunati, Mies \nargues that women have a special position as objects of exploitation \nand potential subjects of struggle, because formal and informal \nsocial processes and practices intimately estrange their bodies \nform them (2). In her understanding, the history of the \ncontemporary women’s movement has typically taken “body \npolitics” as the focal priority (24). The politics of personal emerged \nﬁrst from the struggle for abortion rights, then for sexual liberation \nand against domestic violence (25). Mies argues that it was only \nsubsequently that feminism became understood as a primarily \ncultural movement; initially it was somatically rooted. She claims \nthat the widespread adherence to a division between sex and \ngender in Anglophone feminism is a concession to this culturalist \nbias; in fact the body is fundamentally culturalized, and culture is a \nmeans of coding, constructing, and disciplining the body. Mies \nargues that an equality of exploitation for the two sexes is \nimpossible in a capitalist society, even in the most technologically \nadvanced societies, despite all of the eﬀorts that have been made in \nthis direction (21). For her, this is not only because of the need to \ndivide the working class, or the instrumentalizing of maternity, but \nalso the result of a fundamental estrangement from the body and \nits labor produced by a patriarchal capitalist worldview.\nMies views reproductive labor as the primary form of work in order \nto produce the conditions of life. As a result, her criticism of Marx \nis stronger than her predecessors; in her view, classical Marxism \nartiﬁcially separates work and nature in order to neglect woman’s \ncontribution, which it relegates to biological determinism (52). In \nfact, she entirely inverts Marx’s priority for productive labor, \nregardless of whether the mode of production emphasizes use-\nvalue or exchange-value. Rather than viewing productive work as \nthe main activity of humanity, Mies argues that this is secondary to \nthe feminine eﬀort to provide care labor. She argues that Marx’s \nunderstanding of history, depending on the transformation of \nnature by labor, inherently accepts masculinist preconceptions.\nFurther, Mies argues that this event is not relegated to the past. \nRather, an ongoing destruction and subordination of women is \nnecessary to the continuing expansion and accumulation of capital. \nIn doing so, she draws on dependency theory, such as the work of \nSamir Amin, André Gunder Frank, and Immanuel Wallerstein. In \naddition, she writes about her personal research and commitments \nto the feminist movement in India (151−156). In her view, the \npractice of amniocentesis in order to accomplish sex-selective \nabortions is of a piece with domestic partner violence and the \nappalling increase in rapes. Mies argues that these cannot be \nconsidered as mere survivals or relics of the feudal past (157). \nRather, they are motivated by social adherence to new capitalist \nideologies that devalue the labor of women. With regard to sexual \nassaults, Mies views this as an attempt to reinstate a patriarchal \nideology of feminine self-sacriﬁce. It punishes women who leave the \nhome, thereby forcing them to remain dependent and consumed \nwith domestic responsibilities. Mies also discusses sex tourism as a \nproﬁtable market from the commodiﬁcation of the bodies of women \nin the periphery by men from central economies. In general, she \nargues that the contemporary world system propagates a \n“patriarchal, sexist and racist ideology of women which deﬁnes \nwomen basically as housewives and sex objects” (142). Further, she \nargues that these are not merely cultural prejudices but are \neconomically inscribed in the ﬁnancial, productive, and \nreproductive work that founds the world’s political and economic \ninstitutions.\nMies argues that her perspective is not biologically determinist. \nRather, through an investigation of anthropological data, she \nlocates the origins of patriarchy in a transformation of labor \naccording to which the instruments of work “are the hands and the \nhead, but never the womb or the breast of a woman” (45). Women’s \ngathering is the fundamental endeavor that maintains the \ncommunity. As hunting becomes the primary activity of men, this \ninitially secondary eﬀort becomes central and displaces the \nsigniﬁcance of the home (58). The privilege of manual and \nintellectual labor over care work, she says, was enforced by the \ndiscovery of weapons by men who had become hunters and \nsubsequently warriors (57−61). In her view, the beginnings of \npatriarchy are not rooted in biological diﬀerence or in a mode of \nproduction, but in fact are located in a particular type of tool and \nthe possibility of its destructive use.\nAt this point, I think that some questions are raised by Mies’ \nanalysis and the way that it locates domination in the beginnings of \ntechne and the possibility of aggressive use of that techne by the \nmale sex. In a sense, Mies can appear to be developing a radical \nfeminist version of the famous account of the beginnings of \noppression by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Like Rousseau, she posits an \ninitial human nature which is caring and good, and which is \ncorrupted by the discovery of artiﬁce. A number of commentators \nhave analyzed critically the understanding of technology as a \ndangerous supplement, and in particular the compatibility of this \nclaim with conventional, patriarchal modes of thought. While Mies \nargues that she is not denigrating all technology, and that women \nhad their own tools in order to perform care labor, it is not clear \nhow the development of technology could prevent contamination by \nits possible use as weaponry. For example, one might consider a \nsurgical scalpel, which is a healing tool that depends on incision. It \nwould seem that any technological advance could have potentially \ninjurious eﬀects, and that to eschew developments that carry the \npossibility of abuse would stiﬂe the possibility of any type of human \ntransformation mediated by the technological.\nFurther, Mies speciﬁes that it was the production of a surplus of \ngoods, as well as weaponry, that founded class society, partly \nfacilitated by this technological advance (65). In advocating the \nreturn to a subsistence society and the rejection of not only arms \nbut all luxuries as a feminist imperative, she risks, for example, \nfurther disenfranchising the disabled, who need or want the use of \nprostheses that go beyond the natural capacities of the body. Donna \nHaraway famously suggested a powerful counterpoint to Mies’ view \nof femininity as natural and ascetic in her “Cyborg Manifesto” \n(149−182). In addition, the schema suggested by Mies seems to \nexclude the possibility of transgender life, or at least to reject its \nclassiﬁcation as feminine.\nHowever, Mies’ fundamental argument, that the technological \nadvances concomitant with the accumulation of capital are \nthemselves destructive to the ecological foundations of human life, \nis troubling and compelling. Her application of autonomist feminist \nideas toward an ecofeminist outlook raises unavoidable questions. \nMies writes\n",

    "chunk_full": "[T]he whole world is now structured into one system \nof unequal distribution of labour under the dictates \nof capital accumulation […] based on the social \nparadigm of the predatory hunter/ warrior who, \nwithout himself producing, is able by means of arms \nto appropriate and subordinate other producers, \ntheir productive forces and their products (71).\nIt is necessary to maintain this critique of the violent and \ndestructive aspects of the tendency of global society today, while \navoiding a nostalgic or purist return to origins. Mies’ project of an \nautarkic, self-suﬀicient economy seems unlikely to survive or to \nwithdraw itself from a global economy, and she gives very tentative \nsuggestions on how this could be achieved (220). The struggle \nagainst class domination, against the dispossession of pre-capitalist \nformation in colonial spaces, and against the annihilation of \necological fundamental, may need to take place along lines closer \nto those formulated by Dalla Costa and Fortunati; that is, as a \nstruggle immanently produced by capital and the relations of \nproduction that it engenders, rather than by means of withdrawal.\nMies gave the name “primitive accumulation” to her studies of the \nseizure of women’s bodies, colonial spaces, and nature by capitalist \nlogic and practices (83). As discussed earlier in this essay, this \nnewly emphasized concept from Marx became fundamental for the \nmore recent analyses written by Federici. Dalla Costa, Fortunati \nand Mies never cite Foucault in their foundational works and do not \nuse the term “biopolitics.” However, Federici correctly notes that \ntheir emphases on reproductive labor and on “body politics” \neﬀectively develop a biopolitical analysis alongside Foucault’s \nfamous studies of psychiatry and prisons (15). Moreover, while \nFoucault became fascinated by neoliberalism in the later years of \nhis life, the autonomist feminists maintain a much more \noppositional perspective toward the economic and political \nstructures of the contemporary world–because they view these \nconventions as fundamentally rooted in violence done to women.\nWhat Do the Autonomist Feminists Contribute to Feminism \nToday?\nContemporary feminist theories have developed sensitivity to the \nmultiplicity of experiences and struggles that characterize the \ncontemporary world. Today, feminism and queer theory avoid \nessentialisms of experience on the basis purely of sexism, racism, \nhomophobia, transphobia, or class exploitation, and we endeavor to \ntake into account the manner in which these factors inﬂect or \ntransform one another. A biopolitical approach provides a further \nextension of this analytic perspective in understanding the means \nthat subjects are produced, reproduced and disciplined. As \nFoucault formulated it, biopolitics is not primarily a question of \nlived experience; it is ﬁrst a series of strategies formulated by \nelites. However, the power and knowledge that animates biopolitics \nalways expects and is met by unpredictable forms of resistance \npracticed by individuals and groups. For this reason, it is \npotentially a theory of great practical value for oppressed people.\nAttention to the biopolitics of gender and reproductive labor \nrecorded by autonomist feminists can contribute a great deal to \nfeminist and queer theory and practice. By combining an analysis of \nthe Foucaldian type with Marxism and decolonization theory the\nautonomist feminists developed a structural critique that locates \nthe devaluation of women, their bodies, and their labor, as well as \nthe violence exerted against them, in processes that have their own \nrationality and logic. Further, these thinkers are able to understand \nthe mechanisms of compulsory heterosexuality, as well as the ways \nthat new forms of love and social relationships, seemingly escaping \ntraditional values, can be recuperated by exploitive economic and \npolitical norms.\nMies and Federici do not begin with the individual, but rather with \na political economy that is basically indiﬀerent to moral \nimperatives. As a result, they are able to locate trauma and harm \nnot only in oppressive cultural formations, but also in the necessity \nof exploitation that grounds economic development. The autonomist\nfeminists practiced an innovative means of approaching violence \nand immiseration produced by states, institutions, and individuals \nthat can appear abstract – locating these ills in the devaluation of \nreproductive labor. Abstraction, however, is conducive to producing \nnew bonds of commonality and shared experience, because it is one \nstep removed from the immediacy of personal experience and more \ncommunicative as a result. Their criticism can also appear \nunusually totalizing, in that neo-colonialism, racism, homophobia, \nand misogyny are all traced back to the needs of capital and the \nstates that administer it. However, this very tendency to locate \ncommon enemies has a positive outcome; it becomes the grounds \nfor solidarity among all those who are administered and controlled \nby exploitive institutions, transactions, and relationships.\nWorks Cited \nAlthusser, Louis.

    "chunk_full": "Simians, Cyborgs, and Women \nThe idea that nature is constructed, not discovered - that truth is made, not \nfound - is the keynote of recent scholarship in the history of science. \nTracing the gendered roots of science in culture, Donna Haraway's writings \nabout scientific research on monkeys and apes is arguably the fmest \nscholarship in this tradition. She has carefully studied the publications, the \npapers, the correspondence, and the history of the expeditions and institu-\ntions of primate studies, uncovering the historical construction of the \npedigrees for existing social relations - the naturalization of race, sex, and \nclass. Throughout this book she is analysing accounts, narratives, and stories \nof the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs (cybernetic organ-\nisms: systems which embrace organic and technological components). She \nalso looks critically at the immune system as an information system, and \nshows how deeply our cultural assumptions penetrate into allegedly value-\nneutral medical research. In several of these essays she explores and \ndevelops the contested terms of reference of existing feminist scholarship; \nand by mapping the fate of two potent and ambiguous words - 'nature' and \n'experience' - she uncovers new visions and provides the possibility of a new \npolitics of hope. \nHer recent book, Primate Visions, has been called 'outstanding', 'original', \n'brilliant', 'important' by leading scholars in the field. Simians, Cyborgs, and \nWomen contains ten essays written between 1978 and 1989. They establish \nher as one of the most thoughtful and challenging feminist writers today. \nDonna Haraway is a historian of science and Professor at the History of \nConsciousness Board, University of California, Santa Cruz. She received \nher doctorate in biology at Yale and is the author of Crystals, Fabrics, and \nFields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology and \nPrimate Visions: GCllder, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Scimee. \n",

    "chunk_full": "Introduction \nT\nhis book should be read as a cautionary tale about the evolution \nof bodies, politics, and stories. Above all, it is a book about the \ninvention and reinvention of nature - perhaps the most central \narena of hope, oppression, and contestation for inhabitants of \nthe planet earth in our times. Once upon a time, in the 1 ~7?S' ~e au~or was \na proper, US socialist-feminist, white, female, honumd bIOlOgIst, who \nbecame a historian of science to write about modem Western accounts of \nmonkeys, apes, and women. She belonged to those odd categories, invisible \nto themselves, which are called 'unmarked' and which are dependent upon \nunequal power for their maintenance. But by the last essays;she. ~as turned \ninto a multiply marked cyborg feminist, who tried to keep her pohucs, as well \nas her other critical functions, alive in the unpromising times of the last \nquarter of the twentieth century. The book examines the breakup ofv~rsions \nof Euro-American feminist humanism in their devastating assumpuons of \nmaster narratives deeply indebted to racism and colonialism. Then, adopting \nan illegitimate and frightening sign, the book's tale tu~s to the possibili~es \nof a 'cyborg' feminism that is perhaps more able to remam attuned to speCIfic \nhistorical and political positionings and permanent partialities without \nabandoning the search for potent connections. \nA cyborg is a hybrid creature, composed of organism and machine. But, \ncyborgs are compounded of special kinds of machines and special kinds of \norganisms appropriate to the late twentieth century. Cyborgs are post-\nSecond World War hybrid entities made of, first, ourselves and other \norganic creatures in our unchosen 'high-technological' guise as information \nsystems, texts, and ergonomically controlled labouring, desiring, and repr~­\nducing systems. The second essential ingredient in cyborgs is machines 10 \ntheir guise, also, as communications systems, texts, and self-acting, ergono-\nmically designed apparatuses. \nThe chapters comprising Part One of this book examine feminist struggles \nover the modes of producing knowledge about, and the meanings of, the \nbehaviour and the social lives of monkeys and apes. Part Two explores \ncontests for the power to determine stories about 'nature' and 'experience' -\ntwo of the most potent and ambiguous words in English. Part Three focuses \non cyborg embodiment, the fate of various feminist concepts of gender, \nreappropriations of metaphors of vision for feminist ethical and epistemol.o-\ngical purposes, and the immune system as a biopolitical map of the chIef \n",

Throughout these diverse \ncontents, this book treats constructions of nature as a crucial cultural process \nfor people who need and hope to live in a world less riddled by the \ndominations of race, colonialism, class, gender, and sexuality. \nInhabiting these pages are odd boundary creatures - simians, cyborgs, and \nwomen - all of which have had a destabilizing place in the great Western \nevolutionary, technological, and biological narratives. These boundary crea-\ntures are, literally, monsters, a word that shares more than its root with the \nword, to demonstrate. Monsters signifY. Simians, Cyborgs, and Women interro-\ngates the multi-faceted biopolitical, biotechnological, and feminist theoret-\nical stories of the situated knowledges by and about these promising and \nnon-inoocent monsters. The power-differentiated and highly contested \nmodes of being of these monsters may be signs of possible worlds - and they \nare surely signs of worlds for which we are responsible. \nSimians, Cyborgs, and Women collects essays written from 1978 through \n1989, a period of complicated political, cultural, and epistemological foment \nwithin the many feminisms which have appeared in the last decades. \nFocusing on the biopolitical narratives of the sciences of monkeys and apes, \nthe earliest essays were written from within US Eurocentric socialist-\nfeminism. They treat the deep constitution of nature in modern biology as a \nsystem of production and reproduction, that is, as a labouring system, with \nall the ambiguities and dominations inherent in that metaphor. How did \nnature for a dominant cultural group with immense power to make its stories \ninto reality become a system of work, ruled by the hierarchical division of \nlabour, where the inequities of race, sex, and class could be naturalized in \nfunctioning systems of exploitation? What were the consequences for views \nof the lives of animals and people? \nThe middle set of chapters examines contests for narrative forms and \nstrategies among feminists, as the heteroglossia and power inequities within \nmodern feminism and among contemporary women became inescapable. \nThe section concludes with an examination of ways of reading a modern \nNigerian-British author, Buchi Emecheta, as an example of contests among \ndifferendy situated African, Afro-American, and Euro-American critics over \nwhat will count as women's experience in the pedagogical context of a \nwomen's studies classroom. What kind of accountability, coalition, opposi-\ntion, constituencies, and publishing practices structure particular readings of \nsuch an author on such a topic? \nPart Three, 'Differential Politics for Inappropriate/d Others', contains \nfour essays. The phrase, 'inappropriate/ d others', is borrowed from the \nVietnamese film-maker and feminist theorist, Trinh T. Minh-ha.

Her metaphors suggest a geometry for considering the relations of \ndifference other than hierarchical domination, incorporation of 'parts' into \n'wholes', or antagonistic opposition. But her metaphors also suggest the hard \nintellectual, cultural, and political work these new geometries will require, if \nnot from simians, at least from cyborgs and women. \nThe essays show the contradictory matrices of their composition. The \nexamination of the recent history of the term sex/gender, written for a \nGerman Marxist dictionary, exemplifies the textual politics embedded in \nproducing standard reference-work accounts of complicated struggles. The \nCyborg Manifesto was written to fmd political direction in the 1980s in the \nface of the hybrids 'we' seemed to have become world-wide. The examina-\ntion of the debates about 'scientific objectivity' in feminist theory argues for a \ntransformation of the despised metaphors of organic and technological vision \nin order to foreground specific positioning, multiple mediation, partial \nperspective, and therefore a possible allegory for feminist scientific and \npolitical knowledge. \nNature emerges from this exercise as 'coyote'. This potent trickster can \nshow us that historically specific human relations with 'nature' must \nsomehow - linguistically, ethically, scientifically, politically, technologically, \nand epistemologically -\nbe imagined as genuinely social and actively \nrelational; and yet the partners remain utterly inhomogeneous. 'Our' \nrelations with 'nature' might be imagined as a social engagement with a \nbeing who is neither 'it', 'you', 'thou', 'he', 'she\" nor 'they' in relation to 'us'. \nThe pronouns embedded in sentences about contestations for what may \ncount as nature are themselves political tools, expressing hopes, fears, and \ncontradictory histories. Grammar is politics by other means. 'What narrative \npossibilities might lie in monstrous linguistic figures for relations with \n'nature' for ecofeminist work? Curiously, as for people before us in Western \ndiscourses, efforts to come to linguistic terms with the non-representability, \nhistorical contingency, artefactuality, and yet spontaneity, necessity, fragility, \nand stunning profusions of 'nature' can help us refigure the kind of persons \nwe might be. These persons can no longer be, if they ever were, master \nsubjects, nor alienated subjects, but - just possibly - multiply heterogeneous, \ninhomogeneous, accountable, and connected human agents. But we must \nnever again connect as parts to wholes, as marked beings incorporated into \nunmarked ones, as unitary and complementary subjects serving the one \nSubject of monotheism and its secular heresies. We must have agency - or \nagencies - without defended subjects. \nFinally, the mapping of the biopolitical body considered from the \nperspective of contemporary immune system discourse probes again for ways \nto refigure multiplicities outside the geometry of part/whole constraints. \nHow can our 'natural' bodies be reimagined - and relived - in ways that \n",

Elaborate organic \nimages for human society were richly developed by the Greeks. \nThey conceived the citizen, the city, and the cosmos to be built \naccordiog to the same principles. To perceive the body politic as \nan organism, as fundamentally alive and as part of a large cosmic organism, \nwas central for them (Collingwood, 1945).

Throughout the early period of the industrial \nrevolution, a particularly important development of the theory of the body \npolitic linked the natural and political economy on multiple levels. Adam \nSmith's theory of the market and of the division of labour as keystones of \nfuture capitalist economic thought, with Thomas Malthus's supposed law of \nthe relation of population and resources, together symbolize the junction of \nnatural forces and economic progress in the formative years of capitalist \nindustrialism. The permeation of Darwin's evolutionary theory with this \nform of political economy has been a subject of considerable analysis from \nthe nioeteenth century to the present (Young, 1969). Without question, the \nmodem evolutionary concept of a population, as the fundamental natural \ngroup, owes much to classical ideas of the body politic, which in tum are \ninextricably ioterwoven with the social relationships of production and \nreproduction. \nThe union of the political and physiological is the focus of this chapter. \nThat union has been a major sourCe of ancient and modem justifications of \n",

The degree to which the \nprinciple of domination is deeply embedded in our natural sciences, \nespecially in those disciplines that seek to explain social groups and \nbehaviour, must not be underestimated. In evading the importance of \ndominance as a part of the theory and practice of contemporary sciences, we \nbypass the crucial and difficult examination of the conlml as well as the social \nfunction of science. We leave this central, legitimating body of skill and \nknowledge to undermine our efforts, to render them utopian in the worst \nsense.

We have perversely worshipped \nscience as a reified fetish in two complementary ways: (I) by completely \nrejecting scientific and technical discipline and developing feminist social \ntheory totally apart from the natural sciences, and (2) by agreeing that \nlnature' is our enemy and that we must control our 'natural' bodies (by \ntechniques given to us by biomedical science) at all costs to enter the \nhallowed kingdom of the cultural body politic as defmed by liberal (and \nradical) theorists of political economy, instead of by ourselves. This cultural \nbody politic was clearly identified by Marx: the marketplace that remakes all \nthings and people into commodities. \nA concrete example may help explain what I see as our dangerous \nmisunderstanding, an example which takes us back to the point of union of \nthe political and physiological. In Civilizalion a71d lis DiSC01llenIS, Freud \n(1962) developed a theory of the body politic that based human social \ndevelopment on progressive domination of nature, particularly of human \nsexual energies. Sex as danger and as nature are central to Freud's system, \nwhich repeats rather than initiates the traditional reduction of the body \npolitic to physiological starting points. The body politic is in the first instance \nseen to be founded on natural individuals whose instincts must be con-\nquered to make possible the cultural group. Two recent neo-Freudian and \nneD-Marxist theorists have ironically reworked Freud's position in illuminat-\ning ways for the thesis of this essay: one is Norman O. Brown, the other \nShulamith Firestone. Freud, Brown, and Firestone are useful tools in a \ndissection of the theories of the political and physiological organs of the body \npolitic because they all begin their explanations with sexuality, add a dynamic \nof cultural repression, and then attempt to liberate again the personal and \ncollective body. \nBrown (1966), in Luve's Body, developed an elaborate metaphorical play \nbetween individual and political bodies to show the extraordinary patriarchal \nand authoritarian structure of our conceptions and experiences of both. The \nphallus, the head; the body, the state; the brothers, the rebellious overthrow \nof kingship only to establish the tyranny of the fraternal liberal market -\nthese are Brown's themes. If only the father was head, only the brothers \ncould be citizens. The only escape from the domination that Brown explored \nwas through fantasy and ecstasy, leaving the body politic unchallenged \nin its fundamental male supremacy and in its reduction to the dy-\nnamic of repression of nature. Brown rejected civilization (the body \npolitic) in order to save the body; the solution was necessitated by his \nroot acceptance of Freudian sexual reductionism and the ensuing logic \nof domination. He turned nature into a fetish worshipped by a total return \ntD it (polymorphous perversity).

She has been \nimmensely important to feminists in this task. I think, however, that she \ncommitted the same mistake that Brown did, that of 'physiological reduction \nof the body politic to sex', which fundamentally blocks a liberating socialism \nthat neither fatalistically exploits the techniques given by sciences (while \ndespairing of transforming their content) nor rejects a technical knowledge \naltogether for fantasy. Firestone located the flaw in women's position in the \nbody politic in our own bodies, in our subservience to the organic demands \nof reproduction. In that critical sense she accepted a historical materialism \nbased on reproduction and lost the possibility for a feminist-socialist theory \nof the body politic that would not see our personal bodies as the ultimate \nenemy. In that step she prepared for the logic of the domination of \ntechnology -\nthe total control of now alienated bodies in a machine-\ndetermined future. She made the basic mistake of reducing social relations \nto natural objects, with the logical consequence of seeing technical control as \na solution. She certainly did not underestimate the principle of domination \nin the biobehavioural sciences, but she did misunderstand the status of \nscientific knowledge and practice. That is, she accepted that there are \nnatural objects (bodies) separate from social relations. In that context, \nliberation remains subject to supposedly natural detenninism, which can \nonly be avoided in an escalating logic of counterdomination. \nI think it is possible to build a socialist-feminist theory of the body politic \nthat avoids physiological reductionism in both its forms: (I) capitulating to \ntheories of biological determinism of our social position, and (2) adopting the \nbasically capitalist ideology of culture against nature and thereby denying our \nresponsibility to rebuild the life sciences. I understand Marxist humanism to \nmean that the fundamental position of the human being in the world is the \ndialectical relation with the surrounding world involved in the satisfaction of \nneeds and thus in the creation of use values. The labour process constitutes \nthe fundamental human condition. Through labour, we make ourselves \nindividually and collectively in a constant interaction with all that has not yet \nbeen humanized. Neither our personal bodies nor our social bodies may be \nseen as natural, in the sense of existing outside the self-creating process \ncalled human labour. What we experience and theorize as nature and as \nculture are transformed by our work. All we touch and therefore know, \nincluding our organic and our social bodies, is made possible for us through \nlabour. Therefore, culture does not dominate nature, nor is nature an \nenemy.

To reappropriate the biosocial sciences \nfor new practices and theories, a critical history of the physiological politics \nbased on domination that have been central in animal sociology is important. \nThe biosocial sciences have not simply been sexist mirrors of our own social \nworld. They have also been tools in the reproduction of that world, both in \nsupplying legitimating ideologies and in enhancing material power. There \nare three main reasons for choosing to focus on the science of animal, \nespecially primate, groups. \nFirst, its subject and procedures developed so as to span the nature-\nculture split at precisely the same time in American intellectual history, \nbetween 1920 and 1940, when the ideology of the autonomy of the social \nsciences had at last gained acceptance, that is, when the liberal theory of \nsociety (based on functionalism and hierarchical systems theories) was being \nestablished in the universities. Intrinsic to the new liberal relations of natural \nand social disciplines was the project of human engineering - that is, the \nproject of design and management of human material for efficient, rational \nfunctioning in a scientifically ordered society. Animals played an important \nrole in this project. On the one hand, they were plastic raw material of \nknowledge, subject to exact laboratory discipline. They could be used to \nconstrUct and test model systems for both human physiology and politics. A \nmodel system of, for example, menstrUal physiology or socialization proces-\nses did not necessarily imply reductionism. It was precisely direct reduction \nof human to natural sciences that the post-Spencerian, post-evolutionary \nnaturalist, new ordering of knowledge forbade. The management sciences of \nthe 1930S and after have been strict on that point. It is part of the \nnature-culture split. On the otj1er hand, animals have continued to have a \nspecial status as natural objects that can show people their origin, and \ntherefore their pre-rational, pre-management, pre-cultural essence. That is, \nanimals have been ominously ambiguous in their place in the doctrine of \nautonomy of the human and natural sciences. So, despite the claims of \nanthropology to be able to understand human beings solely with the concept \nof culture, and of sociology to need nothing but the idea of the human social \ngroup, animal societies have been extensively employed in rationalization \nand naturalization of the oppressive orders of domination in the human body \npolitic.s They have provided the point of union of the physiological and \npolitical for modem liberal theorists while they continue to accept the \nideology of the split between nature and culture. \nSecond, animal sociology has been central in the development of the most \n",

We \nneed to understand how and why animal groups have been used in theories \nof the evolutionary origin of human beings, of 'mental illness', of the natural \nbasis of cultural co-operation and competition, oflanguage and other forms \nof communication, of technology, and especially of the origin and role of \nhuman forms of sex and the family. In shon, we need to know the animal \nscience of the body politic as it has been and might be.6 I believe the result of \na liberating science of animal groups would better express who the animals \nare as well; we might free nature in freeing ourselves. \nThird, the levels at which domination has formed an analytical principle in \nanimal sociology allow a critique of the embodiment of social relations in the \ncontent and basic procedures of a natural science in such a way as to expose \nthe fallacies of the claim to objectivity, but not in such a way as to permit \nfacile rejection of scientific discipline in our knowledge of animals.

Carpenter earned his \nPhD at Stanford for a study of the effects on sexual behaviour of the removal \nof the gonads of male pigeons in mated pairs. He then received a National \nResearch Council Fellowship in 1931 to study social behaviour of primates \nunder the direction of Robert M. Yerkes of the Laboratories of Comparative \nPsychobiology at Yale University. Yerkes had recently established the first \ncomprehensive research institution for the psychobiological study of anthro-\npoid apes in the world. For Yerkes, apes were perfect models of human \nbeings. They played a major part in his sense of mission to promote scientific \nmanagement of every phase of society, an idea typical of his generation. \nIt has always been a feature for the use of the chimpanzee as an \n\"'l'erimental animal to shape it intelligently to specification instead of \ntrying to preserve its natural characteristics. We have believed it impor-\ntant to conven the animal into as nearly ideal a subject for biological \nresearch as is practicable. And with this intent has been associated the \nhope that eventual success might serve as an effective demonstration of \nthe possibility of re-creating man himself in the image of a generally \nacceptable ideal. (Yerkes, '943, p. 10)' \nHe, then, designed primates as scientific objects in relation to his ideal of \nhuman progress through human engineering. \nYerkes was interested in the apes in two main regards - their intelligence \nand their social-sexual life. For him intelligence was the perfect expression \nof evolutionary position. He saw every living object in terms of the \noutstanding problem of experimental comparative psychology in America \nsince its inception around I goo: the intelligence test. Species, racial, and \nindividual qualities were fundamentally tied to the central index of intelli-\ngence, revealed on the one hand through behaviour-testing and on the other \nthrough the neural sciences. He had designed the army intelligence tests \nadministered to recruits in the First World War, tests seen to provide a \nrational basis for assignment and promotion, to indicate natural merit fitting \nmen for command (Yerkes, 1920; Kevles, 1968). B His role in the war was \nentirely compatible with his role as an entrepreneur in primate studies. In \nboth cases he saw himself and his scientific peers working to foster a rational \nsociety based on science and preserved from old ignorance, embodied \nespecially in religion and politics. \nThe social-sexual life of primates was for Yerkes thoroughly intenwined \nwith their intelligence. Mind would order and rule lower functions to create \nsociety.

Primate intelligence allowed sexual states to stimulate \nthe beginnings of human concepts of social right and privilege. The sexual \nreductionism hardly needs emphasis. His study linking sex and power was \ntypical of work in the 1930s, and hardly different from much to this day. In \nan early feminist critique, Ruth Herschberger (1948) marvellously imagined \nthe perspective of Josie, the female chimpanzee whose psychosexual life was \nof such concern to Yerkes. Josie seems notto have seen her world in terms of \ntrading sex for 'privilege', but to Yerkes that economic link of physiology and \npolitics seemed to have been scientifically confirmed to lie at the organic \nbase of civilization. \nIn addition to direct investigation of physiological sex and social behaviour \nin human beings' closest relatives, Yerkes exercised, along with his peers, a \ntremendous influence on the overall direction of the scientific study of sex in \nthis country. He was for twenty-five years chairman of the Rockefeller \nFoundation-funded National Research Council Committee for Research on \nProblems of Sex (CRPS). This committee, from 1922 until well after the \nSecond World War when federal funding became massively available for \nscience, provided the financial base for the transformation of human sex into \na scientific problem. Fundamental work on hormones and behaviour, \nsex-linked differences in mental and emotional qualities, marital happiness, \nand finally the Kinsey studies were all funded by the Committee for \nResearch on Problems of Sex. It played a key role in opening up sexual \ntopics for polite discussion and respectable investigation in an era of \nundoubted prurience and ignorance.9 \nHowever, the opening was double edged; the committee, in its practice \nand ideological expressions, was structured on several levels according to the \nprinciple of the primacy of sex in organic and social processes. To make sex \na scientific problem also made it an object for medical therapy for all kinds of \nsexual 'illness', most certainly including homosexuality and unhappy mar-\nriages. The biochemical and physiological basis of the therapeutic claims \nimmensely strengthened the legitimating power of scientific managers over \nwomen's lives. The committee closed the escape holes for those who \nrejected the American Freud's kind of sexual reductionism: whether from \nthe psychoanalytic or physical-chemical directions, sex was safely in the care \nof scientific-medical managers. Monkeys and apes were enlisted in this task \nin central roles; as natural objects unobscured by culture, they would show \nmost plainly the organic base in relation to which culture emerged. That \nthese 'natural objects' were thoroughly designed according to the many-\nlevelled meanings of an ideal of human engineering has hardly been noticed. \nCarpenter arrived at Yale's primate laboratories already enmeshed in the \nweb of funding and 'practice represented by the CRPS.

From his education, funding, and social environment, \nthere waS little reason for Carpenter to reject the basic assumptions that \nidentified reproduction and dominance based on sex with the fundamental \norganizing principles of a natural body politic. What Carpenter added, \nhowever, was significant. Methodologically, he established the demanding \nskill of naturalistic observation of wild primates in two extraordinarily careful \nfield studies, one on New World howler monkeys and one on Asian gibbons. \nThese studies are worthy of note because they are simultaneously excellent, \ncommanding work and fully reflective of social relations based on dominance \nin the human world of scientists. to Theoretically, Carpenter tied the \ninterpretations of the laboratory disciplines of comparative psychology and \nsexual physiology to evolutionary and ecological field biology centred on the \nconcepts of population and community. In short, he started to link the \nelements of natural and political economy in new and important ways. The \nclassic Darwinian conception of natural political economy of populations \nbegan to be integrated with the physiological and psychological sciences that \ngreatly flourished in the early twentieth century. The integration would be \ncomplete only after the Second World War, when Sherwood Washburn and \nhis students transformed physical anthropology and primate studies by \nsystematically exploiting the evolutionary functionalism of the neo-\nDarwinian synthesis and the social functionalism of Bronislaw Malinowski's \ntheory of culture. \nIn addition to linking levels of psychobiological analysis to modern \nevolutionary theory, Carpenter analysed primate groups with the tools of \nearly systems theory that were simultaneously providing the technical base \nfor the claim to scientific maturity of the social sciences based on concepts of \nculture and social group.

In 1938 he collected about 400 rhesus monkeys in \nAsia and freed them on Cayo Santiago. Mter a period of social chaos, they \norganized themselves into six groups containing both sexes and ranging in \nsize from three to '47 animals. The monkeys were allowed to range freely \nover the thirty-seven-acre island and to divide space and other resources \nwith little outside interference. The first major study undertaken of them \nwas of their sexual behaviour, including periodicity of oestrus, homosexual, \nautoerotic, and 'nonconfonnist' behaviour. Carpenter's conclusions noted \nthat intragroup dominance by males was strongly correlated with sexual \nactivity, and so presumably with evolutionary advantage. All the sexist \ninterpretations with which we have become monotonously familiar were \npresent in the analysis of the study, including such renderings of animal \nactivities as, 'Homosexual females who play masculine roles attack females \nwho play the feminine role prior to the formation of a female-female consort \nrelation' (Carpenter, '964, p. 339). \nIn harmony with the guiding notion of the ties of sex and dominance in the \nfundamental organization of the rhesus groups, Carpenter performed what \non the surface is a very simple experiment, but one which represents the \nwhole complex of layered explanation of the natural body politic from the \nphysiological to the political. After watching the undisturbed group for one \nweek as a control, he removed the 'alpha male' (the animal judged most \ndominant on the basis of priority access to food, sex, and so on) named \nDiablo, from his group. Carpenter then observed the remaining animals for \none week, removed the number 2 male, waited another week, removed the \nnumber 3 male, waited, restored all three males to the group, and again \nobserved the social behaviour. He noted that removal of Diablo resulted iIi \nimmediate restriction of the territorial range of the group on the island \nrelative to other groups. Social order was seriously disrupted. 'The group \norganization became more fluid and there was an increase in intra-group \nconflict and fights . .. After a marked disruption lasting three weeks, the \ngroup was suddenly restructured when the dominant males were released' \n(1964, p. 362). Social order was restored, and the group regained its prior \nfavourable position relative to other groups. \nSeveral questions immediately arise. Why did Carpenter not use as a \ncontrol the removal of other than dominant males from the group to test his \norganizing hypothesis about the source of social order? Literally, he removed \nthe putative head from the collective animal body.

He drew from theories \nof embryological development that tried to explain the formation of complex \nwhole animals from simpler starting materials of fertilized eggs. One \nimportant embryological theory used the concept of fields organized by axes \nof activity called dominance gradients. A field was a spatial whole formed by \nthe complex interaction of gradients. A gradient was conceived, in this \ntheory, to consist of an ordered series of processes from low to high levels of \nactivity measured, for example, by differential oxygen consumption. Note \nthat at this basic level dominance was conceived as a purely physiological \nproperty that could be objectively measured. The slope of a gradient could \nbe shallow or steep. Several gradients making up a field would be organized \naround a principal axis of greatest slope, the organization centre. An \norganism grew in complexity through integrated multiplication of dominance \nsystems. An appropriate experimental system within developmental physi-\nology designed to test theories of fields, gradients, physiological dominance, \nand organization centres was the simple hydra. It had only one axis or \npossible gradient: head to tail. One could cut off the polyp's head, observe \ntemporary disorganization of remaining tissue, and see ultimate re-\nestablishment of a new head from among the physiologically 'competing' \ncells. Further, one could remove much or little from the head portion of the \nactivity gradient and test the extent of ensuing organic disorganization.\" \nCarpenter conceived social space to be like the organic space of a \ndeveloping organism, and so he looked for gradients that organized the \nsocial field through time. He found such a physiological gradient of activity \nin the dominance hierarchy of the males of the social group. He performed \nthe theoretically based experiment of head removal and 'observed' ensuing \nphysiological competition among cells or organs (Le., other points - animals \n- on the activity-dominance gradient) to re-establish a chief organization \ncentre (achieve alpha male status) and restore social harmony. Several \nconsequences flow from these identifications. \nFirst, other groups of animals in the society could be ordered on activity \naxes as well; females, for example, were found to have a dominance \nhierarchy of less steepness or lower slope. Young animals had unstable \ndominance gradients; the observation underlying that interpretation was that \nordinary dominance behaviour could not be reliably seen and that immature \nanimals did not show constant dominance relations to one another. As \nunseen 'observations' became just as important as evidence as seen ones, a \nconcept of latent dominance followed readily. From this point, it is an easy \nstep to judgements about the amount of dominance that functions to \norganize social space (call that quantity leadership) and the amount that \ncauses social disruption (call that pathological aggression).

Far from competition and co-operation being mutual \nopposites, the former is the precondition of the latter - on physiological \ngrounds. If the most active (dominant) regions, the organization centres, of \nan organism are removed, other gradient systems compete to re-establish \norganic order: a period of fights and fluidity ensues within the body politic. \nThe chief point is that without an organizing dominance hierarchy, social \norder supposedly is seen to break down into individualistic, unproductive \ncompetition. The control experiment of removing other animals than the \ndominant males was not done because it did not make sense within the whole \ncomplex of theory, analogies to individual organisms, and unexamined \nassumptions. \nThe authoritarian personality studies bring us to the second level of \nexplanation of the body politic implicit in Carpenter's experiment: the \npsychological. The idea of a dominance hierarchy was derived in the first \ninstance from study of 'pecking orders' in domestic chickens and other birds \ninitiated by the Norwegian Thorlief Schjelderup-Ebbe (1935) as early as \n'9'3, but not incorporated into American comparative psychology in any \nimportant way until the '930s. Then animal sociology and psychology, as \nwell as human branches of the disciplines, focused great attention on ideas of \ncompetition and co-operation. Society was derived from complex interac-\ntions of pairs of individuals, understood and measured by psychological \ntechniques, which constituted the social field space. One looked for axes of \ndominance as organizing principles on both the physiological and psycho-\nlogical levels. \nThe third and last level implicit in Carpenter's manipulation is that of \nnatural political economy. The group that loses its alpha male loses in the \ncompetitive struggle with other organized organic societies. The result \nwould be reflected in less food, higher infant mortality, fewer offspring, and \nthus evolutionary disadvantage or even extinction. The market competition \nimplicit in organic evolutionary theory surfaces here. The theory of the \nfunction of male dominance nicely joins the political economy aspect of the \nstudy of animal behaviour and evolution (competitive, division of labour, \nresource allocation model) with the social integration aspect (co-operative \nco-ordination through leadership and social position) and with the purely \nphysiological understandings of reproductive and embryological phenom-\nena. All three perspectives link functionalist equilibrium social models -\nestablished in the social sciences of the period - to explicit ideological, \npolitical concerns with competition and co-operation (in labour struggles, for \nexample).

Elton Mayo (1933) - the influential Harvard, anti-labour union, \nindustrial psychologist-sociologist of the same period -\ncalled such a \ncommunity the 'Garden of IndUStry,.12 \nThe political principle of domination has been transformed here into the \nlegitimating scientific principle of dominance as a natural property with a \nphysical-chemical base. Manipulations, concepts, organizing principles - the \nentire range of tools of the science - must be seen to be penetrated by the \nprinciple of domination. Science cannot be reclaimed for liberating purposes \nby simply reinterpreting observations or changing terminology, a crass \nideological exercise in any case, which denies a dialectical interaction with \nthe animals in the project of self-creation through scientific labour. But the \ndifficult process of remaking the biosocial and biobehavioural sciences for \nliberation has begun. Not surprisingly, one of the first steps has been 10 \nswitch the focus from primates as models of human beings to a deeper look \nat the animals themselves - how they live and relate to their environments in \nways that may have little to do with us and that will surely reform our sense of \nrelation to nature in our theories of the body politic. These 'revisionist' \nscientific theories and practices deserve serious attention. Of them, 'femin-\nist' perspectives in physical anthropology and primatology have stressed \nprinciples of organization for bodies and societies that do not depend on \ndominance hierarchies. Dominance structures are still seen and examined, \nbut cease to be used as causal explanations of functional organization. \nRather, the revisionists have stressed matrifocal groups, long-term social \nco-operation rather than short-tenn spectacular aggression, flexible process \nrather than strict structure, and so on. The scientific and ideological issues \nare complex; the emerging work is justly controversial. \nIn our search for an understanding of a feminist body politic, we need the \ndiscipline of the natural and social sciences, just as we need every creative \nform of theory and practice. These sciences will have liberating functions in \nso far as we build them on social relations not based on domination. A \ncorollary of that requirement is the rejection of all forms of the ideological \nclaims for pure objectivity rooted in the subject-object split that has \nlegitimated our logics of domination of nature and ourselves.

The science of non-human primates, primato-\nlogy, may be a source of insight or a source of illusion. The issue rests on our \nskill in the construction of mirrors. \nPrimatology has focused on two major themes in interpreting the \nsignificance of animals for understanding human life - sex and economics, \nreproduction and production. The crucial transitions from a natural to a \npolitical economy and from biological social groups to the order of human \nkinship categories and systems of exchange have been basic concerns. These \nare old questions with complex relations to technical and ideological \ndimensions of biosocial science.

Perhaps, many have \nthought and some have hoped, the key to the extraordinary sociability of the \nprimate order rests on a sexual foundation of society, in a family rooted in \nthe glands and the genes. Natural kinship was then seen to be transformed \nby the specifically human, language-mediated categories that gave rational \norder to nature in the birth of culture. Through classi1jing by naming, by \ncreating kinds, culture would then be the logical domination of a necessary \nbut dangerous instinctual nature. Perhaps human beings found the key to \ncontrol of sex, the source of and threat to all other kinds of order, in the \ncategories of kinship. We learned that in naming our kind, we could control \nour kin. Only recently and tentatively have primatologists seriously chal-\nlenged the indispensability of these sorts of explanations of nature and \nculture. \nBiosocial theories focusing on production rest on a fundamental premise: \nhumanltind is self-made in the most literal sense. Our bodies are the product \nof the tool-using adaptation which predates the genus Homo. We actively \ndetermined our design through tools that mediate the human exchange with \nnature. This condition of our existence may be visualized in two contradic-\ntory ways. Gazing at the tools themselves, we may choose to forget that they \nonly mediate our labour. From that perspective, we see our brains and our \nother products impelling us on a historical course of escalating technological \ndomination; that is, we build an alienated relation to nature. We see our \nspecific historical edifice as both inevitable human nature and technical \nnecessity. This logic leads to the superiority of the machine and its products \nand ensures the obsolescence of the body and the legitimacy of human \nengineering. Or, we may focus on the labour process itself and reconstruct \nour sense of nature, origins, and the past so that the human future is in our \nhands. We may return from the tool to the body, in its personal and social \nforms. This chapter is about efforts to know the body in the biosocial \nconditions of production and reproduction. Our bodies, ourselves. \nMore particularly, this chapter is about the debate since approximately \n'930 in primate studies and physical anthropology about human nature - in \nmale bodies and female ones. The debate has been bounded by the rules of \nordinary scientific discourse. This highly regulated space makes room for \ntechnical papers; grant applications; informal networks of students, teachers, \nand laboratories; official symposia to promote methods and interpretations; \nand finally, textbooks to socialize new scientists. The space considered in \nthis chapter does not provide room for outsiders and amateurs.

Feminism, I suggest, can \ndraw from a basic insight of critical theory. The starting point of critical \ntheory - as we have learned it from Marx, the Frankfurt school, and others-\nis that the social and economic means of human liberation are within our \ngrasp. Nevertheless, we continue to live out relations of domination and \nscarcity. There is the possibility of overturning that order of things. The \nstudy of this contradiction may be applied to all our knowledge, including \nnatural science. The critical tradition insists that we analyse relations of \ndominance in consciousness as well as material interests, that we see \ndomination as a derivative of theory, not of nature. A feminist history of \nscience, which must be a collective achievement, could exantine that part of \nbiosocial science in which our alleged evolutionary biology is traced and \nsupposedly inevitable patterns of order based on domination are legitimated. \nThe examination should play seriously with the rich ambiguity and \nmetaphorical possibilities of both technical and ordinary words. Feminists \nreappropriate science in order to discover and to define what is 'natural' for \nourselves.' A human past and future would be placed in our hands. This \navowedly interested approach to science promises to take seriously the rules \nof scientific discourse without worshipping the fetish of scientific objectivity. \nMy focus will be four sets of theories that emphasize the categories of \nreproduction and production in the tangled web of the reconstruction of \nhuman nature and evolution. The first, centring on reproduction, was the \nwork of Sir Solly Zuckerman. Born in '904 in South Africa, he studied \nanatomy at the University of Cape Town, then earned his MD and BS at \nUniversity College Hospital, London. He combined in complex and iIlumi-\nnating ways research interests in human palaeontology and physical anthro-\npology, reproductive physiology and the primate menstrual cycle, and broad \nzoological and taxonomic questions focused on primates. His social base \nincluded zoological gardens and research laboratories in British universities \nand medical schools; his training and career reflect intersections of the \nperspectives of anatomist, biochemist, anthropologist, clinician, administra-\ntor, and government science adviser? He has been the architect of an \nextremely influential theory that sexual physiology is the foundation of \nprimate social order. He also offered a variation of the theory of the origin of \nhuman culture in the hunting adaption, which delineated crucial conse·· \nquences for the division oflabour by sex and the universal institution of the \nhuman family. In focusing on the sexual biology of monkeys, Zuckerman \nconstructed a logic for setting the boundaries of human nature.

Therefore, only on that basis may we make valid comparisons of \nhuman and non-human ways of life. \nA second set of theories stressing reproduction is that of Thelma Rowell, \nnow at the University of California at Berkeley. She earned her doctorate in \nthe early '960s under Raben Hinde of Cambridge, the man who also \nsupervised]ane Goodall's dissenation on chimpanzees. That period saw the \nbeginning of a stiD continuing acceleration of publication based on long-\nterm field observations of wild primates. Rowell's training was in zoology \nand ethology. Her fIrst intention was to write her thesis on mammalian \n(hamster) communication, using the ethological approach worked out \nparticularly by Niko Tinbergen at Oxford. Because Tinbergen then felt the \nmethodology to be inappropriate to the non-stereotypical social communica-\ntion of mamrnaIs, Rowell pursued her ideas at Cambridge under Hinde, a \nmajor synthesizer of American comparative psychology and Continental \nethology. Rowell's research (1966a, I 966b, '970), which has used both \ntraditions, has been concerned with primate communication, the baboon \nmenstrual cycle, comparison of the naturalistic behaviour of monkeys with \ntheir behaviour in captivity and in laboratory experimental situations, and \nmother-infant socialization systems. An outspoken critic of the pervasive \ndominance concept, she has made social role and stress her overriding \ntheoretical concerns. \nYet both Zuckerman and Rowell, who are very different, adopt varieties \nof biological and sociological functionalism that set limits on permitted \nexplanations of the body and body politic. The most imponant is the \nfunctionalist requirement of an ultimate explanation in terms of equilibrium, \nstability, balance. Functionalism has been developed on a foundation of \norganismic metaphors, in which diverse physiological parts or subsystems \nare co-ordinated into a harmonious, hierarchical whole. Conflict is sub-\nordinated to a teleology of common interests.3 Both Zuckerman's and \nRowell's explanations also reflect the ideolOgical Concerns of their society in \ncomplex ways, which can instruct feminist effons to deal with biological and \nsocial theories. \nThe third and founh sets of theories are reconstructions of human \nevolution. Both claim to reveal the meaning of crucial adaptations, both \nfocus on production. They see adaptation as a concept relating to the \ninterpretation offunctional complexes, of ways oflife in which behaviour and \nstructure mutually inform each other. Ifboth Rowell and Zuckerman restrict \nthemselves (almost) to talking about monkeys, Sherwood Washburn of the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley, his former student Adrienne ZihIman, \nand her colleague at the University of California at Santa Cruz, Nancy \nTanner, argue about the connection of physical and social anthropology. \nTelling scientific tales about human nature, they are unapologetic about the \n",

There can be \nno hiding behind mechanistic or purely structural explanations in evolution-\nary biology and anthropology. But since function is still pre-eminent, the \nresulting scientific approach may be called evolutionary functionalism. \nThe central figure in the third set of theories, Washburn, is most \nimmediately associated with the modem man-the-hunter hypothesis. This \nmaintains that the hunting adaptation has been the fundamental functional \ncomplex which set the rules for nearly alI the history of the genus Homo until \nthe very recent past. He has also generated the theory of tool use as the \nmotor of evolution of the human body, including the brain and its power of \nlanguage. His influential vision of the self-made species has earned him \npraise from such Marxist feminists as Eleanor Leacock (1972) and such \nFreudian feminists as Dorothy Dinnerstein (1977). He has also been an \narch-villain of the piece because of the overwhelming concentration on \nmales as practically the only active son of human being. Washburn is, in my \nopinion, both more complicated and more imponant than either approach \nreveals. By developing functional anatomy as pan of the synthetic theory of \nevolution and then extending the approach to the social behaviour of living \nprimates, he has integrated sophisticated genetic theory and disciplined field \nand experimental methodology into the practice of evolutionary reconstruc-\ntion. \nAuthors of the founh set of theories, Zihlman and Tanner, have produced \nan excellent critique of Washburn's scientific sexism with the use of his own \ntools. They could not have thought as they do without the functional physical \nanthropology Washburn has advanced. Tanner and Zihlman have also added \na new twist to feminist, scientific evolutionary reconstruction: the use of \nsociobiological concepts. The pleasure and irony of their approach is that the \nideas of some of the most explicidy sexist theories have been enlisted to tell \nanother story. Yet at this level, the feminist debate is still about the nature \nand existence of human universals. Theories of origins quickly become \ntheories of essences and limits (see Figure I). \nThe 1930S was a decade of exciting advance in the study of sexual \nendocrinology. Early in the decade Solly Zuckerman produced a powerful \ntheory of the physiological basis of mammalian society in general and \nprimate society in particular. He repeatedly assened that he intended only to \nadopt a zoologist's perspective on animal sociology and to avoid extrapolation \nto human, cultural, language-mediated behaviour. Yet his work informed \ninvestigations into the origin of human organization and the use of primates \nin studies of it. He gave the concept of dominance an up-to-date scientific \nlegitimation, for example, connecting it to the new endocrinology.

The taxonomic project was undertaken in the \nbook, Fzmaional Affinities of Mall, Monk<rys, and Apes (1933). Here, Zucker-\nman constructed his 'hunting hypothesis' to account for the transition from \nnature to culture. \nBut first we must look at his general theory of non-human primate society, \nfound in The Social Life of Monk<rys and Apes (1932). Zuckerman imposed an \nimportant limit on primatology. He did not recognize a ladder of perfection \nof living primates representing stages of mental function and corresponding \ndegrees of social co-operation (which always meant hierarchical organiza-\ntion) through which human beings must have passed. Thus, 'Only the \nbehavior common to all apes and monkeys can be regarded as representing a \nsocial level through which man once passed in the prehuman stages of his \ndevelopment' (1932, p. 26). Only one thing met this requirement: 'When all \nquestions of its applications to human behavior are laid aside, and when \nteleological speculation is disregarded, the chief subject matter of a scientific \nmammalian sociology is seen to be ecology, reproductive physiology, and \nthose influences which can be classed together as due to the variations of the \nindividual' (1932, p. 28). That nod to ecology is the last we hear of it until a \nprecipitating cause was later required to fire the cultural answer (hunting) to \nprimate sexuality. Individual variation explained details, 'But social behavior \n- the interrelation of individuals within a group - is determined primarily by \nthe mechanisms of reproductive physiology' (p. 29). \nZuckerman had already told the reader that his excursion into mammalian \nsociology had begun in response to the urgings of anthropologists; he aimed \nto replace anecdotal accounts of animal societies with hard physiology. He \nsimply assumed that the important bone of contention was the nature and \norigin of the human family, itself the origin of society. At this point, \nZuckerman turned to the writings of the American mammologist, G. S. \nMiller, who had criticized Malinowski's contention that the human family \nwas unique, that kinship represented the crucial human-animal break. \nMalinowski regarded the human physiology on which the institution of \nkinship (i.e., fatherhood) was imposed as unique. In contrast, Miller and \nZuckerman agreed that one found all the biological essentials of the human \nfamily (namely, constant female receptivity) in mammalian reproductive \nassociation. Zuckerman simply developed that viewpoint into an analysis of \nconsequent social forms among primates. Freud's story of the origin of \ncivilization in repression was prefigured on the prehuman level. Zucker-\nman's ·story was based on the comparative physiological anatomy of the \ndifferent primate groups informed by his recent discovery of the baboon \nmenstrual cycle and on the behaviour of a colony of Hamadryas baboons on \nMoakey Hill in the London Zoo since 1925.

Reproductive \nassociation is fraught with danger because here competitive success requires \nthe co-operation of other animals. Males fight to obtain the maximum \nnumber of reproductive opportunities. These elements Zuckerman retained \nfrom Darwin. They did not appear teleological to him in the same way as \ndiscussions of animal altruism and co-operation. Males dominate females to \npreclude another source of competitive insubordination. After the bare \nessentials of reproduction are accounted for, animals separate to avoid \nfurther inevitable injuries from sexual battles. Sexual periodicity (seasonal-\nity) evolved to protect the animal atoms from each other during the rest of \nthe year. Mother-young groups hardly constitute society. In any case, these \ngroups are general to mammals and cannot explain primate societies. \nDifferent degrees of long-term heterosexual association were rigorously \nrelated to requirements of reproduction in the particular ecological environ-\nments available to the animals. Males compete to accumulate the meanS of \n(re)production, through which alone they can increase their genetic capital in \nevolution. Females are the means of evolutionary production and the source \nof surplus value. As dominance became the universal medium of exchange \namong males and the measure of value, the political and natural economy of \nHobbes's Leviathan has found its twentieth-century biological expression. \nThe economic order is exclusively physiological in all but human beings, \nwhere cultural ownership of females and property is also to be found. \nTo Zuckerman, the main event in social evolution had been the elimina-\ntion of extreme seasonality and the introduction of year-long association \nbased on the continuous sexual 'receptivity' of females. First the oestrus and \nthen the menstrual cycle introduced regular repeating bouts of sexual \nintercourse. Monthly cycles replaced seasonal ones, and a social revolution \nensued. Continuous association required strong control mechanisms if the \nanimals were to survive it. So developed the 'harem', exemplified by the \nLondon Hamadryas which Zuckerman observed personally during 1929-30 \nand for which he had records dating to the establishment of the colony in \n1925. Especially since the London Hamadryas did not survive on Monkey \nHill - nearly all were killed in brutal fights and only one infant was reared \nsuccessfully - it was important for Zuckerman to establish that captive \nbaboons in extreme conditions of sexual imbalance and crowding still \nrevealed the essential structure of primate society in nature.

Hierarchy and deadly competition were \ncrucial regulators of primate society, not creations of human captors. It was \nalso important for him to convince his readers that variations in social form \namong primates, none of whom had been studied in other than a casual way \nin the wild, were only details imposed upon the fundamental physiologically \ndetermined family. Within the pattern of dominance, such behaviour as \nfemale 'prostitution' (which Zuckerman and Miller defined as presenting for \nnon-sexual reasons) was explained as the beginning of the trading of sexual \nfavours for otherwise competitively unobtainable goods. Grooming, feeding \norder, vocal and gestural expression, allotroent of social space, and many \nother aspects of social behaviour were all derived from the physiologically \ndetermined harem organization of primates. Zuckerman was unequivocal: \nThe argument oudined above goes far toward explaining the broad basis \nof subhuman primate society. The main factor that determines social \ngrouping in subhuman primates is sexual attraction ... The limit to the \nnumber of females held by any single male is deterntined by his degree of \ndominance, which will again depend not only on his own potency, but also \nupon his relationship with his fellow males. (Zuckerman, 1932, p. 31) \nOf course, human beings share with other primates 'a smooth and uninter-\nrupted sexual and reproductive life' (p. 51); yet human beings and their \nfamilies exist in the realm of culture, buffered, if not exempt, from the \nphysiologist's gonadectomies and injections. How did the physiologist \nre-enter the kingdom of culture with his medical tools for producing family \nhealth and behavioural adjustroent within social hierarchy defmed as \nco-operation? Through hunting, through the taste for meat. Returning to \nFundionai Affinities, we meet Zuckerman in his guise as physical anthropo-\nlogist who unites the physiological to the ecological in order to generate a \nlarge-brained hunting animal who needs more complex forms of male \nco-operation and female fidelity in order to feed the family. The reproduc-\ntive unit remains on the throne as the fundamental core of social association \nin the cultural form of kinship, the basic object of the social science of \ncultural anthropology. Again, Zuckerman's logic is elegandy simple. Some \nunknown ecological changes produced selection pressure for prehumans to \nexploit new sources of food, to rework the age-old unspecia1i2ed feeding \npatterns, and to introduce sexual division of labour as a necessary conse-\nquence of the requirements of large-scale meat-eating. Food-sharing \nnecessitated the human form of the family, which for Zuckerman meant \nselection pressure for 'overt monogamy' and conceptual recognition of \nsignificant social relations (ownership of women) even when no one was \n",

So developed marriage and the \nhunting band of males, with all the startling consequences for the brain and \nits products of speech and culture. \nZuckerman hinted at the later form of the hunting hypothesis that \nemphasized the tool-using adaptation in the origin of the self-made species. \nBut more important was the fact that the all-male band - the human form of \nco-operation signalling the divorce of culture from nature _ became a \nscientific, even a physiological, object in Zuckerman's hands. The valuable \nfemale continued to pose the threat of disorder through sexuality. Co-\noperation came to mean conscious male regulation of previously natural \nhierarchy and competition, which in tum had been the fruits of permanent \nfemale sexuality. These themes were not new with Zuckerman, but the way \nhe integrated them into modem physiological disciplines was. Further, his \nbiological ideology did not violate, but actually reinforced, the important \ndoctrine of the autonomy of biological and social science, of animal and \nhuman order. Zuckerman left full room for functionalist social anthropology. \nHe only reformed Malinowski's physiology. \nZuckerman's importance in the development of primate behaviour studies \nthemselves has not been his scant empirical observations, but his provision of \na theory that met the needs of rapidly advancing new disciplines. At the same \ntime, he rescientized conventional prejudices with the liberal ideology that \nclaimed that culture was autonomous from previous forms of biolOgical \ndeterminism. That same liberal ideology legitimated a logic of scientific \ncontrol over 'nature', now rationalized as a material given reduced either to \npre-rational danger or ordered resource. The alienating core of this is not \nobscure. Zuckerman set questions for workers to follow that even in their \nasking reinforced scientific beliefs about natural male competition and \ndangerous female sexuality. His tie of sexuality to dominance in ways \nacceptable to the physiological and behavioural sciences of the '930S helped \neetablish the status of dominance as a trait or fact rather than a concept. \nPrimatologists have continued to ask about the selective advantage of \ndominance behaviour and have tended to assume, rather than test, a \ncorrelation of breeding advantage with an entity called dominance. Not until \n'965, with a paper by two of Sherwood Washburn's students, was his theory \nof the origin of primate society in year-round female sexuality convincingly \nlaid to rest.' Zuckerman's mode of blending covert Freudianism, biochemi-\ncal mechanisms, and studies of social behaviour has had a long and \ninfluential life. \nAt first giance, the only comparisons of Thelma Rowell with Zuckerman \nmust be in contrast.

She \ndoes not claim scientific purity for a language bathed in multiple waves of \nmeaning in the common tongue as well as in scientific tradition. Her \narguments have been zoological and explicitly sociological rather than an \nextrapolation from reproductive physiology. She is known for her care in \ndividing cage space for captive monkeys to permit more naturalistic be-\nhaviour, and for excellent field studies, rather than for physiological \narguments about provoked extreme behaviour as the window to the normal. \nRather than emphasizing primate universals, Rowell's papers are permeated \nby particularism, by counsels to notice complexity, by insistence on variabil-\nity in a manner reminiscent of early proponents of the culture concept and \ncultural particularism. Moreover, Rowell is working in very different \nscientific and ideological circumstances. She benefits from and contributes \nto the now extensive literature based on direct field studies of primates, \nstudies which themselves referred back to Zuckerman but went beyond that \nto which he had access. This body of literature has tended to reject \nZuckerman's doctrines on sex but to retain focus on dominance. Finally, \nRowell writes to an audience sensitized to the femirtist implications of \nbiosocial theory. It is not an accident that she emphasizes female behaviour \nand active social roles and finds dominance to be, at best, a convenient \nexpression for predicting the frequency of some learned behaviours. \nBut it would be a dangerous mistake to see Rowell's work as simply \nexemplitying normal scientific progress in rooting out unnecessary prejudice \nwhile accumulating better data. Nor does her work siroply substitute more \nsatisfYing (to me) female prejudices for Zuckerman's infuriating male \nconsciousness. In fact, Rowell and Zuckerman are like each other in a \ncrucial way, which I believe indicates part of the nature of the ideological \nfunction of iropeccable work in perfectly controlled laboratory science. In \n'stress', Rowell does have a global category of explanation corresponding to \nZuckerman's sexual physiology.

One which we must note is that of the idea of 'obsolescence' of \ncertain biological systems and the medical function of relieving stressed, \nperhaps obsolescent, behaviour patterns. A second level of meaning implicit \nin systems functionalism is the imperative of 'reproduction' of the system as \na social whole and as a breeding population. Behaviour can be explained, \nthen, ultimately in terms of system maintenance or pathological failure to \nachieve such stability. \nIn '974, Rowell summarized the arguments against use of the dominance \nconcept to understand social structure. She gave two major lines of \napproach: (I) presenting all putative dominance behaviours as learned \nresponses easily accounted for by current theories in animal psychology; and \n(2) removing the basis for considering dominance as a trait or adaptive \ncomplex subject to selection pressures. That is, so-called dominance \nbehaviours do not. seem to relate to reproductive success. In addition to \namusing points about the slippery nature of concepts like 'latent dominance', \nwhich enter arguments to fill gaps in observation, Rowell asserts that \nconditions of observation introduce the detemtinants in which one should \nexpect social animals to learn responses called dominance. Hierarchy for \nRowell is primarily an artefact of methods of observation. Reinforcing this \nposition is the discovery that different measures of dominance do not \ncorrelate highly with each other, and hierarchies worked out by different \nmeasures do not reveal the same social structure. Thus it is hard to see what \nobserved behaviours related to dominance have to do with evolution, which \nrequires a genetic basis for selection. In Rowell's words, 'the function of \ndominance becomes a non-question' (1974, p. 151; italics altered). \nBut function does remain the essential question, the grail that unifies the \nactors in this chapter. For Rowell, function must be seen in terms of the \nconcept of social system. Communication analysis, studies of mother-young \ninteractions, role change in relation to age and sex class, social subsystems \nbased on matrilines (kinship), territory and hierarchy as spatial order, and \nvariation of social structure in response to environmental variables: these \nbecome the areas of interest, the analytical objects that bear on the \nstructural-functional explanation of system in terms of function. Rowell's \ntheoretical stance is most plain in her very useful, linguistically sophisticated \nbook, Social Belurviour of Monkeys (1972). The problem of the social system is \nthe problem of multiple-variable analysis in fluid structures in dynamic \nequilibrium through time and space. The debt of animal sociology to human \nsociology and anthropology from Bronislaw Malinowski, L. J. Henderson, \nand Talcott Parsons has hardly begun to be noticed, much less critically \nexamined. \nHow does stress relate to the social system? Ironically, through the \n",

Very sensitive animals would be \neasily roused to fear, flight, or cringing postures. Such sensitivity would \nreasonably be associated with high levels of adrenal-stimulating hormones. \nSo the capacity to produce ACTH in 'stressful' situations would be \nreasonably postulated to have a genetic foundation. These are testable \npropositions, at least in principle. Calm animals might be called 'dominant' \nby observers simply because they move freely in social space and take freely \nfrom available resources, while their nervous comrades cringe or move away. \nRowell would see the poor huddling beast as the stimulus or cause of the \nresulting 'hierarchy'. Such a social .cheme should be called a subordination \norder. A variety of response thresholds to stressful situations would be \nadaptive in the social group in nature. Both nervous and calm animals would \nhave a role in efficiendy monitOI+.lg the environment for danger or for \nmaintaining intragroup peace. The genetic diversity in the population \nunderlying the differences in response stress would be kept in evolution. \nOne must note how functionalist notions of social role for overall system \nbalance, genetic concepts for biochemical and hormonal function, and \npsychological approaches to dominance-subordination all converge in the \ncentral idea of stress. \nStress as a global, multi-layered concept embedded in functionalist \nexplanation provides the critical tie between Thehna Rowell and Sherwood \nWashburn.

In Hamburg'S \nand Washburn's work, the darker side of functionalist explanation is starkly \nrevealed; the metaphoric structure surrounding stress ceases to be more \ncongenial than dominance. Hamburg has been a principal figure in evolu-\ntionary theories of emotional adaptive configuration, which lead to the notion \nof our obsolescent biology. Medical management of emotions maladaptive in \n'modem society' seems justified to relieve pathological stress and maintain \nthe social system. 'Modem society' itself seems given by some sort of \ntechnological imperative laid over our limiting biological heritage.

Evolutionary theory here joins a \nsociology of systems and a psychology of personality and emotion in modern \nversions of a pleasure calculus connected to the organic, motivational base of \nlearning theory. Rowell summarizes: \nA zoologist, however, must always return to the question of selective \nadvantages ... It is so very obvious that monkeys enjoy being together \nthat we take it for granted. But pleasure like every other phenomenon of \nlife is subject to, and the result of, evolutionary pressure - we enjoy a \nthing because our ancestors survived better and left more viable offspring \nthan their relations who did not enjoy (and so seek) comparable stimuli \n... This is speculation; but it is by research which examines the function \nof social systems of monkeys and other animals that we shall be able to \nunderstand fully their mechanisms. (1972, pp. 174, 180) \nWashburn and Hamburg have shared the same analysis, but have applied it \nto another concept, again often perceived as a thing, in the vocabulary of \nmeaning-laden scientific words: aggression, especially male aggression. \nThrough this concept we must make a transition from explanations based on \ntheories of reproduction to those based on production in human evolution \nand primate behaviour studies. Clearly, reproduction and production are \ncomplements, not opposites. But we must see how Washburn reached a \n'man-the-hunter' theory from consideration of the economic functions of \nthe species, while Zuckerman traced primate order through reproductive \nphysiology, and Rowell led us to understand the junction of sociological and \nevolutionary notions of reproducing systems. \nWashburn and Hamburg (1968) developed themes initiated in their \ncollaboration in 1957, when Washburn spent a year as a fellow at the \nStanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and \nfurthered in 1962-63 when Washburn and Hamburg organized at the centre \na full year of conferences and collaboration among the new, exciting, \nworld-wide community of primatologists. In 'Aggressive behavior in Old \nWorld monkeys and apes\" the two collaborators introduced their work as \npart of the study of the forces that produced humankind. They wished to pay \nattention to unique human biology and unique conditions of human \nevolution. They saw aggression as a fundamental adaptation or functional \ncomplex common to the entire primate order, including human beings. \n'Order within most primate groups is maintained by a hierarchy, which \ndepends ultimately primarily on the power of males ...

In non-human primates, aggression is constantly re-\nwarded, and, the authors maintain, aggressive individuals (males) leave more \noffspring. So they argue for selection of a system of co-adapted genes \ninvolving complex feedback among motor anatomy, gestural anatomy, \nhormones, brain elements, and behaviour. Presumably, all parts of the \naggressive complex evolve. The functions requiring aggression did not abate \nfor humankind, Hamburg and Washburn believe. Protection, policing, and \nfinally hunting all required a continued selection for male organisms who \neasily learned and enjoyed regulated fighting, torturing, and killing: \nThroughout most of human history societies have depended on young \nadult males to hunt, to fight, and to maintain the social order with \nviolence. Even when the individual was cooperating, his social role could \nbe executed only by extremely aggressive action that was learned in play, \nwas socially approved, and was presumably gratifYing. (1968, p. 291) \nBut with the advance of civilization, this biology has become a problem. It is \nnow often maladaptive because of our accelerating technological progress. \nOur bodies, with the old genetic transmission, have not kept pace with the \nnew language-produced cultural transmission of technology.

The lesson here, the liberal scientist argues, is \nnot to favour a particular social order -\nthose are political and value \nquestions - but to establish the preconditions for all advanced society, \nnamely, scientific management of now inefficient, maladaptive, obsolescent \nbiology. We are only one product, and one subject to considerable break-\ndown.

The purpose is to begin to recognize how Washburn's career as \na careful, experimental scientist has been part of the scientific and social \ncontroversies on human nature as the foundation for the human future. We \nmust understand how Washburn could simultaneously be the co-author of \nthe article on evolution of aggression, an opponent of sociobiology, alter-\nnately a hero and villain for Robert Ardrey, a favourite of some Marxist \nfeminists, and the teacher of both sociobiological feminist Adrienne.zihlman \nand of sociobiological sexist Irven DeVore. He is rightly all these things and \nunusually consistent and unified in his methods, theories, and practices. \nPerhaps the key to Washburn is that he has produced a fundamental theory \nwith tremendous implications for the practice of many sciences and for the \nrules of speculative evolutionary reconstruction. In Kuhnian terms, Wash-\nburn seems to have something basic to do with scientific paradigms. In \nMarxist terms, he has to do with alienated theorizing of the established \ndisorder. \nWashburn's fundamental innovation in physical anthropology was evident \nin the publication of his widely reprinted papers, 'The new physical \nanthropology' (1951 a) and 'The analysis of primate evolution with particular \nreference to man' (195Ib). He applied the new population genetics to the \nstudy of primate evolution. For Washburn population genetics meant that \nthe process of evolution was the crucial problem, not the fossil results. \nTherefore, selection and adaptation were his central concepts. Adaptive \ntraits could only be interpreted by understanding conditions or forces \ncapable of producing the traits. The first problem that confronted the \nphysical anthropologist was how to identifY a 'trait'. Washburn practised a \nnew kind of theoretical and practical dissection of the body into 'functional \ncomplexes', whose meaning had to be sought in their action during life. For \nexample, instead of measuring the nose, he analysed the forces in the central \nregion of the face from chewing and growth. That task required model \nexperimental systems of living animals. Instead of serting up scales of \nevolution based on brain enlargement, he analysed regions of the body \ninvolved in adaptive transfonnations related to locomotion, eating, and \nsimilar functions. In sum, 'The anatomy of life, of integrated functions, does \nnot know the artificial boundaries which still govern the dissection of a \ncorpse' (195Ia, p. 303). \nWashburn was part of a larger revolution in physical anthropology \naccompanied by the discovery of new fossils, dating techniques, experimental \npossibilities, and more recently, molecular taxonomy. One of the revolution's \ncentral objects was the small-brained South African human-ape, Australo-\npithems. 'The discovery of the South African man-like apes, or small-\nbrained men, has made it possible to outline the basic adaptation which is \nthe foundation of the human radiation' (195Ib, p. 70).

'But the use of tools brings in a set of factors \nwhich progressively modifies the evolutionary picture. It is particularly the \ntask of the anthropologist to assess the way the development of culture \naffected physical evolution' (1951 b, p. 7 I). Evolutionary and social function-\nalism again come together; both, for Washburn, are analyses of the meaning \nof living systems, of action, of ways of life. From the 1950S Washburn \nmaintained that functional anatomy and the synthetic theory of evolution \nlaid to rest for ever the old conflicts of physical and social anthropology. \nIn 1958, Washburn and his former student, Virginia Avis, contributed a \npaper to a symposium on behaviour and evolution, which had been \norganized, beginning in 1953, to effect a synthesis of comparative psychology \nand the synthetic theory. Washburn's emphasis on the importance of \nbehaviour made his interest in the psychological consequences of evolution-\nary adaptation natural. In that paper, 'The evolution of human behavior', \nWashburn and Avis (1958) developed the consequences of the hunting \nadaptation, including enlarged curiosity and mobility, pleasure in the hunt \nand kill, and new ideas about our relation to other animals. Perhaps most \nimportant, 'Hunting not only necessitated new activities and new kinds of \ncooperation but changed the role of the adult male in the group ... The very \nsame actions which caused man to be feared by other animals led to more \ncooperation, food sharing, and economic interdependence within the group' \n(pp. 433-4). The human way of life had begun. \nFrom seeing behaviour first as motor activity and then as psychological \norientations, it was a short, logical step to looking at behaviour as social \nsystem. Beginning in '955, almost casually, Washburn investigated not only \nactions of individual organisms but of social systems. The baboon studies of \nWashburn and Irven DeVore, with all their emphasis on male roles in \nprotection and policing as models of pre.-adaptations to a human social \nsystem, were appropriate outgrowths of evolutionary functional anatomy. \nDifferences between human and monkey society were always highlighted; \nWashburn never engaged in chain-of-being reconstructions. He looked at \nanimal social systems the same way as he looked at forces determining \ngrowth in kitten skulls -\nas model systems for particular problems in \ninterpreting skull formation in fossils. His was an experimental, comparative \nbiological science based on function. But the baboon model system drove \nhome a lesson: troop structure came from dominance hierarchies of males. \nHunting transformed such structures but only to produce the special roles of \nthe co-operating male band.

S. \nLancaster (1968). This paper has earned Washburn his poor reputation in \nsocialist and feminist circles. Its appearance in a symposium emphasizing the \nhunting nature of man in the midst of years of challenge to sexual, economic, \nand political power is part of the social situation of contemporary evolution-\nary reconstruction. Washburn is not an ideologue; he is a scientist and educa-\ntor. That is the point. interpreting human nature is a central scientific question \nfor evolutionary functionalism. The past sets the rules for possible futures in \nthe 'limited' sense of showing us a biology created in conditions supposedly \nfavouring aggressive male roles, female dependence, and stable social \nsystems appropriately analysed with functional concepts. Telling stories of \nthe human past is a rule-governed activity. Washburn's science changed the \nrules of the game to require argument from the conditions of production. \nIn 'Women in evolution. Part I: innovation and selection in human \norigins', Nancy Tanner and Adrienne Zihlman (1976)6 play by the new rules \nbut tell of a different human nature, of different universals. They focus less \non tools as such and more on the labour process, that is, on a new productivc \nadaptation - gathering. They immediately place themselves within the recent \npopulation genetic developments of sociobiology. Their study explores a \nnatural economy in terms of investment strategies for the increase of genetic \ncapital. Yet Tanner and Zihlman deliberately appropriate sociobiology for \nfeminist ends. They no more make themselves ideologues than Washburn \nhas, but their practice of science is controversial both for internal reasons of \ndebated evidence and argument, and for political reasons. They do not, at \nany point, leave the traditional social space of science. They can stay therc, in \npart, because sociobiology is not necessarily sexist in the sense that Irven \nDeVore or Robert Trivers (1972) have made it, any more than the concept of \nstress necessarily leads to Hamburg's particular ideas on aggression and \nhuman obsolescence. Further, it is not easy to imagine what evolutionary \ntheory would be like in any language other than classical capitalist political \neconomy.7 No simple translation into other metaphors is possible or \nnecessarily desirable. Tanner and Zihlman bring us face to face with \nfundamental questions that have barely been phrased, much less answered. \nHow should we theorize our experience of the past and of 'nature' in new \nways to build adequate concepts for scientific practice and social transforma-\ntion? This question stands in a complicated relation with the internal craft \nrules for working within the natural sciences. \nTanner and Zihlman begin by announcing the goal of understanding \nhuman nature in terms of processes 'which shaped our physical, emotional, \nand cognitive characteristics' (1976, p. 585).

Behaviour does not fossilize for either sex, \nso the problem is one of rational reconstruction, of choosing hypotheses. \nSpecifically, we hypothesize the development of gathering [both plant and \nanimal material] as a dietary specialization of savanna living, promoted by \nnatural selection of appropriate tool using and bipedal behavior. We \nsuggest how this interrelates with the roles of maternal socialization in kin \nselection and offemale choice in sexual selection. We emphasize the con-\nnections among savanna living, technology, diet, social organization, and \nselective processes to account for the transition from a primate ancestor \nto the emergent human species. (Tanner and Zihlman, '976, p. 586) \nThis paper is clearly a normal outgrowth for Zihlman of her '966 \npresentation on bipedal behaviour, in the context of hunting, to a Washburn-\norganized symposium of the American Anthropological Association. Titled \n'Design for Man', the session included Hamburg on emotions as adapta-\ntional complexes and the problem of maladaptive, obsolete patterns. \nLike Washburn, Tanner and Zihlman argue from animal model systems \nand from the most recent genetic theory applied to populations. They see \nchimpanzees as the most closely similar of all living animals to the stem \npopulation that probably gave rise to apes and hominids. So chimpanzees \nmake better mirrors, or models, than baboons do for glimpses of the \nevolution of the human way oflife. The auIhors add to Ihe traditional genetic \nparameters of the synthetic Iheory (drift, migration, and so on), the \nsociobiological genetic concepts of inclusive fitness, kin selection, sexual \nselection, and parental investment. Understanding changes in gene frequen-\ncies of populations from selection pressures operating on individuals \nremains the goal. They note lots of tool use by chimpanzees, wiIh a sex \ndifference in the behaviour. Females make and use tools more often, \nalthough the males seem to hunt more readily. Rigid dominance hierarchies \ndo not occur, although the concepts of high ranks and influence seem useful. \nThe social structure is flexible, but not random. Social continuity seems to \nflow through continuing associations of females, their young, and associates. \nThe transitional population to hominids is imagined to have moved into \nthe savannah, a new adaptive zone. 'A new way of life is initiated by a change \nin behavior; the anatomical changes follow' (Tanner and Zihlman, '976, p. \n586). The new behaviour was greatly enlarged dietary choice accompanied \nby tool use. GaIhering was the early critical invention of hominids. \nFood-sharing with ordinary social groups of females and offspring (includ-\ning male sharing with these groups) resulted. Digging sticks, containers for \nfood, and above all, carrying devices for babies were extremely likely early \ntechnological innovations related to the new diet and sharing habits. \n",

Selection pressure for symbolic communica-\ntion increased. The predation dangers of the savannah were probably dealt \nwith by cunning not fighting, so hominids reduced the need for baboon-like \ndominance and male fighting anatomy. The flexible chimp social structure \nprobably became even' more opportunistic, allowing better understanding of \nthe basis for human cultural diversity. Like Rowell, Tanner and Zihlman \ntake every opportunity to emphasize human possibility and variety. Gather-\ning of plants and animals was unlikely to maintain much selection pressure \nfor an aggressive biology. Cognitive processes, on the other hand, were \ngreatly elaborated in the new productive mode. \nAt this point, Tanner and Zihlman make use of mother-centred units to \nintroduce kin and sexual selection and parental investment. New selection \npressures put a premium on great sociability and co-operation. Babies were \nharder to raise, and bisexual co-operation would be useful. Males learned \nthe friendly interaction patterns, even with strangers, which became crucial \nto the human way of life based on linguistic communities, small bands, and \nfrequent outbreeding. But maintenance of a fighting anatomy including big \ncanines and stereotyped threat gestures would be incompatible wiIh the new \nfunctional behaviours. Females would mate more readily with friendly, \nnon-threatening males. Female sexual choice has been shown to be general \nin mammalian groups, and the hominid stem was not likely to have been an \nexception. Two things leap at tile reader who has followed Zuckerman's and \nWashburn's hunting arguments. First, female receptivity has been renamed \nfemale choice, with large genetic consequences. Second, the anatomy of the \nreduced canines is reinterpreted when different behaviour and different \nfunctions are postulated. \nTanner and Zihlman believe anthropology as a whole is better served by \ntheir different reconstruction, based on similar evidence. \nObservers usually begin from their own perspective, and so inadvertently \nthe question usually has been: how did Ihe capacity and propensity for \nadult Western male behaviors evolve?

It has been against \nthe rules to argue from a position of biological reductionism. But the goal of \neach tale has been a picture of human universals, of human nature as the \nfoundation for culture. IronicaUy, reconstructions of human nature useful to \nfeminists were derived from two of the theories most despised by socialist-\nfeminist thought: functionalism and sociobiology. They have been criticized \nas ideological justifications of unjust economic and political structures, as \nrationalizations for the reproduction of present relations of the body and \nbody politic. Obviously, as RoweU, Tanner, and Zihlman show, these \ntheories can be deployed for other ends: to stress human and animal \nvariability, complexity, capacity for change.

This is compatible with a larger refusal to pretend that science \nis either only discovery, which erects a fetish of objectivity, or only invention, \nwhich rests on crass idealism.

They show both the given and the possible in a dialectic \nbetween the past and the future. Often, the future is given by the possibility \nof a past. Sciences also act as legitimating meta-languages that produce \nhomologies between social and symbolic systems. That is acutely true for the \nsciences of the body and the body politic.

Organic form, with its hierarchical and physiological \nco-operation and competition based on 'natural' domination and division of \nlabour, gave way to systems theory with its control schemes based on \ncommunications networks and a logical technology in which human beings \nbecome potentially outmoded symbol-using devices. Life science moved \nfrom physiology to systems theory, from scientific medicine to investment \nmanagement, from Taylorite scientific management and human engineering \nof the person to modern ergonomics and population control, from psycho-\nbiology to sociobiology. \nThis fundamental change in life science did not occur in a historical \nvacuum; it accompanied changes in the nature and technology of power, \nwithin a continuing dynamic of capitalist reproduction. This chapter \nsketches those changes in an effort to investigate the historical connection \nbetween the content of science and its social context. The larger question \ninfonning this critique is how to develop a socialist-feminist life science. I \nBecause science is part of the process of realizing and elaborating our own \nnature, of constituting the category of nature in the first place, our \nresponsibility for a feminist and socialist science is complex. We are far from \nunderstanding precisely what our biology might be, but we are beginning to \nknow that its promise is rooted in our actual lives, that we have the science \nwe make historically. As Marx showed for the science of wealth, our \nreappropriation of knowledge is a revolutionary reappropriation of a means \nby which we produce and reproduce our lives. We must be interested in this \ntask. \nThis chapter compares and contrasts the biologies of Robert Mearns \nYerkes and E.O. Wilson to show the transformation of biology from a \nscience of sexual organisms to one of reproducing genetic assemblages. \nThroughout I focus on the machine and market as organizing ideas in life \nscience. Table I outlines the categories of comparison. It is important to \nnote that this chapter does not claim that Yerkes and Wilson singly built \nintellectual systems with conscious relations to the needs of patriarchal \ncapital; rather it examines them as representing important fonnations, so as \nto give an idea where to continue a critical reading of classical biology in the \nprocess of formulating another biology? \nYerkes was committed to development of personality sciences based on \nthe model of physiology and scientific medicine.3 As the goal of scientific \nmanagement in industry in that period was the microcontrol of individual \nworkers, establishment of co-operative hierarchies, and clear separation of \ncontrol functions from manual work, Yerkes' psychobiology was founded on \n",

He \nbuilt a complex evolutionary picture of the relation of sex and mind, raw \nmaterial and engineering, instinct and rational control, that was appropriate \nto a genuinely usable capitalist science. \nBut by the end of his career around 1940, Yerkes' science was already \noutmoded. It was being replaced by a different engineering perspective, \nbased not on physiology, but on the physical sciences' analysis ofinformation \nand energy in statistical assemblages! The physiology of sexual organisms \ngave way to biochemistry, structural analysis, and molecular genetics of \ninformation machines: integrons, replicators, self-assembling biological \nsubsystems such as viruses and cell organelles and populations - the new \nbooks of nature to be read by mathematics.

The social \ngoal of the new life science was clearly statistical control of the mass through \nsophisticated communications systems. Similarly, the damping and control \nof variation, prediction of large-scale pattern, and development of optimiza-\ntion techniques in every kind of system became a basic strategy of social \ninstitutions. Further, everything has become a system. The search has been \nfor evolutionary stable strategies for maximizing profit.

Between 1924 and 1942, \nthrough Yale University and the Rockefeller Foundation, Yerkes assembled \nthe funding, animals, researchers, buildings, maintenance staff, and publica-\ntions which have made it possible to breed, rear, and study chimpanzees in \ncaptivity. He also made the first field studies of wild primate behaviour \npossible (Hilgard, 1965). On a wider level, Yerkes worked to establish the \nutility of primates for interpreting the place of human beings in scientifically \nmanaged corporate capitalism - called nature. His investigations in mental \nand sexual psychobiology included designing tests for all aspects of mental \nfunctions in organisms ranging from daphnia and dancing mice to psycho-\npaths, soldiers, and corporate managers. Yerkes also examined natural \ndominance and co-operation in the evolutionary interrelation of sexual \ninstinct and rational mind.\" This work was a central part of his explicit \nproject of scientific engineering as a proper replacement for the irrational-\nities of received culture.7 \n",

Adaptivity meant solving the problem of \nthe rational control of nature on the level of individual organisms and their \nsocial analogues _ families, labour groups, and other superorganisms.\n8 The \nscientific frameworks for interpreting primate behaviour and biology have \nchanged radically since the early years of Yerkes' work before the First \nWorld War. Knowledge of primates has corresponded to general develop-\nments in biology, psychology, and sociology, as well as to political conflict. \nThe ways arguments have been constructed for relating primate science to \nhuman needs have also changed. But a constant dimension of primate \nstudies has been the naturalization of human history; that is, making human \nnature the raw material rather than the product of history.

The structure of \nco-operation involved the entire complex division oflabour and authority in \ncapitalist production and reproduction. Co-operation most certainly in-\ncluded rational organization of hand and head, of subordination and \ndominance, of instinct and mind. Motivation of co-operation was a manage-\nment problem (Mayo, 1933; Baritz, 1960; Bravermann, 1974). \nIt was also a biomedical problem, necessitating detailed physiological \nknowledge of the 'irrationalities', which could become pathological _ \ninstinct, personality, and culture. These three were closely tied to organic \nsex, and led to the proliferation of scientific disciplines such as endocrin-\nology, gender-differentiated personality studies, Freudian psychotherapy, \nanthropology based on personality and culture, eugenic doctrines of race \nhygiene, and sexual counselling through the birth control movement.9 \nDespite controversies among all these approaches, they shared a grounding \nin organic functionalism based on sexuality. Engineering meant rational \nplacement and modification of human raw material- in the common interest \nof organism, family, culture, society, and industry. Human engineering was a \nkind of medical encouragement of natural homoeostatic mechanisms of \nintelligent integration. The life sciences which studied organic capacity and \nvariation from a physiological viewpoint provided the scientific underpin-\nnings for the application of human engineering. Yerkes helped build those \nsciences. \nYerkes received his PhD at Harvard in '902. Before the First World War, \nhis research in Cambridge and Boston concerned the sensory psychophy-\nsiology and mental capacity of a wide range of organisms. Sensory physiology \nwas intimately related to modes of'adaptivity', or learning, in both individual \nand evolutionary frameworks. Early in his career Yerkes was interested in \nextending his work to primates, and envisaged a comprehensive primate \nresearch station which would include physiology, learning, and social \nbehaviour. Yerkes worked within the framework of comparative psychology, \nwhich studied evolution of animal behaviour as a chain of being, a series of \nincreasingly complex physiological organizations, best shown in growth of \nintelligence. Having defined intelligence as problem-solving behaviour, \nYerkes relied on the construction of testing apparatus for comparing \nlearning strategies of different species and individuals within species. The \nrelation to a hierarchically conceived physiology as the model for this \npsychology cannot be overstressed. As scientific medicine was based on \nexperimental physiology, so too psychological therapies relied on ex-\nperimental psychology (Yerkes, 1913, 1921). \nIn studying adaptivity of primates, Yerkes (1927b, 1928) developed the \n",

It is less well known that Yerkes desigoed his tests under the \nauspices of the army surgeon general and conceived the work as part of the \nmedical management of society (Kevles, 1968; Ann Arbor Science for the \nPeople, 1977, pp. 21-57; Cravens, 1978, pp. 80-5, 181-8). \nAfter the war, Yerkes remained in Washington, DC, forming an economic \nand political base for his lifelong goal of a primate research station. From \n1919 until accepting a professorship in Yale University's new Institute of \nPsychology in 19Z4, he worked within the National Research Council of the \nNational Academy of Sciences. \nTwo committees formed under the auspices of the National Research \nCouncil (NRC) are relevant to the themes of this chapter: the Committee on \nScientific Aspects of Human Migration (CSAHM) and the Committee for \nResearch on Problems of Sex (CRPS). Yerkes was chairman of both, the \nCSAHM from 1922 to '924 and the CRPS from 1922 to '947. Both \ncommittees were set up to study human variability for purposes of rational \nsocial management policy. Neither committee worked from a population \nperspective, but rather from a physiological model of organic capacity, \nvariation, and health. Widespread population genetic and ecology \napproaches to demography and to sexuality only emerged after the Second \nWorld War and were related to the elaboration of communications tech-\nnology and information sciences. \nThe Committee for Research on Problems of Sex grew out of efforts by \nthe New York City Bureau of Social Hygiene to establish a structure of pure \nresearch for enlightened social policy on matters such as sex education, \nfamily counselling, eugenics, venereal disease, divorce, and birth control. 1O \nThe NRC committee was part of an effort to relate medical-physiological \nresearch to social issues. The committee sponsored work in four categories, \nrJOt including direct action agencies:\" (I) biology of sex (systematic, genetic, \nand physiological aspects); (2) physiology of reproduction; (3) infrahuman \npsychobiology of sex; and (4) human psychobiology of sex, including \nanthropological and social-psychological approaches. Two assumptions \nstand out in the records of the sex committee.

Second, the sex instinct was perceived to \nunderlie the whole pyramid of life and human sciences and to be the key to \nunderstanding culture and personality. The CRPS did not conceive of \nscience as rationalizing sexual repression. Quite the opposite: the committee \nin large measure played a liberalizing role. 12 It was committed to facilitating \nrational social engineering. Animal models for human organic capacity and \nvariation allowed human engineering to be an experimental natural science. \nIn that sense, Yerkes built his primate laboratory as a pilot plant for human \nengineering. \nIn consultation with a powerful old friend and colleague, Yale University \nPresident James Rowland Angell, Yerkes planned the Institute of Psychology \nat Yale as the home for his primate research. The Institute housed a range of \ngraduate research on general problems of adaptation; its staff was made up \nof former members of the Committee on Scientific Aspects of Human \nMigration. 13 These men brought with them a commitment to the scientific \nmanagement of race, sex, and class, based on sciences of heredity, drives, \nlearning, and environment, all in a biomedical context grounded in physi-\nology. In 1924, Yerkes moved to New Haven. His early facilities consisted \nof his farm in New Hampshire and a converted old building at Yale, where \nfour young chimpanzees grew up in full view of modern science. Their \npsychosexual and ideational development were the primary concerns. Mind \nand sex were a natural pair (Bingham, 1928). \nIn 1929, Yerkes achieved his dream, a $500,000 grant from the Rockefel-\nler Foundation for a permanent, large research facility on great apes. Grant \nproposals and Foundation correspondence were full of the relevance of the \nproject to human social and psychological issues.\" No other goal could \njustifY the large expense of using chimpanzees as research animals. The \nresulting Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology existed in three parts: (I) \nspecial laboratories for short-term work in New Haven needing special \napparatus, with close co-operation with John Fulton's Department of \nPhysiology in the Medical School; (2) a breeding colony of thirty to fotty \nanimals in Orange Park, Florida, where long-term sexual and ideational \npsychobiological observation and experimentation would be possible; and <.J) \nspecial provision for studies of wild primates in their natural habitat, to \nprovide base line information on the natural social physiology of the \norganisms. IS Research centred on the idea of evolution, and aU but ignored \nthe idea of populations. Animal behaviour was not a genetic science in \nYerkes' and his contemporaries' hands. Or rather, the comparative psycho-\nlogists used the word genetic always in the sense of the genesis of individual \ncapacities. All this would change with the post-Second World War synthesis \nof ethology, neural biology, and population genetics and ecology.

Dominance was \nperceived as inherent to individual organisms; it was probably inheritable, \njust like eye colour or IQ, The second idea was co-operation - from \nhomoeostatic mechanisms at all levels, to deliberate modification of domin-\nance in the interests of higher organization, to everyday rules for running the \nlaboratory. Co-operation and dominance were closely connected on an \norganic level as forms of integration. \nA choice opportunity presented itself for the experimental investigation of \ndominance in the context of family-centred experimental sociology. The \nexperiment tested co-ordination of sexual drive, status hunger, masculine \nand feminine personality types, and evolutionary transformation to higher \nforms of social control. This study carried noteworthy implications for \ncounselling and human social services by relating drive and personality to \nsocial order. \nIn the course of tests for delayed response and representational processes, \nas part of the study of the phylogeny of language, Yerkes observed that \nsexual periodicity and dominance-subordination appeared to influence \nwhich animal of a caged pair would come to the food chute to be examined. \nYerkes (1939) then conducted competitive food experiments on four kinds \nof caged companions: mates, two mature females, mature with immature \nfemales, and two immature females. Pieces of banana were presented one at \na time in a series of ten through a chute in the cage. Along with other \ninformation, the observer recorded which animal of the pair would take the \npiece. Results were correlated with sexual status of the females in terms of \ndominance-subordination and response by 'right or privilege'. Right or \nprivilege meant that in the period of maximum genital swelling of the female, \nthat is, when the female was on heat, the ordinarily dominant male granted \nher the privilege of taking the banana, although dominance itself was not \nseen to reverse. Yet the female acted as ifby right. Yerkes recognized various \nproblems with the data: for example, observations were made in ouly one \ncase for an entire cycle, and variation of the response pattern virtually \nswamped the postulated regularities. Tests of statistical significance were \nnot reported. In female pairs, sexual swelling affected performance on the \nfood priority test, but the animal offering sexual favours would be either the \npreviously 'dominant' or previously 'subordinate' chimp. The sexual market \namong females was disorderly. Even among 'mates', it seemed presence or \nabsence of prior 'friendship' greatly affected the results. But Yerkes spent \nmost of the paper describing in detail a pair which showed clear substitution \nof right and privilege for dominance. The tone was simultaneously tentative \nand expectant that these observations were the beginning of very important \nstudies. Yerkes' experimental social physiology, which explored the sexual \n",

It was the \norganism's basic hunger for social status. 'Assuming that dominance is \nhereditary and that inheritance is independent of sex, men and women might \nbe expected to become creative leaders with approximately equal frequency' \n(Yerkes, '939, pp. 133-4). Culture accounted for actual observed predom-\ninance of male leaders. But the association of 'leadership' and biological \ndominance was considered natural. Yerkes was liberal-to-moderate on the \nsex role controversies of the day and made clear his opinion that human \nfemales should have greater 'opportunity' than allowed by tradition. The \nissue here is not whether Yerkes or other spokespeople for comparative \npsychobiology were or were not liberals in their own time, but the logic of \nnaturalization of the issues in terms of hierarchy from instincts to rational \ncontrol, through personality and associated educational and medical ther-\napies. With the weakening of religion, comparative life science became the \nnew bedrock for value decisions, the more evolutionarily adaptive ground for \njudgement. With respect to the division of labour in the family, which was \nthe model for the division of labour in all of society, the logic of \nnaturalization provided a cornerstone of historical explanation based on \nreproduction. The dynamic was management, not repression. \nTo make the above point concrete, let us follow Yerkes through his \nanalysis of the implications of the interweaving of sex hungers with \ndominance drives. First, Yerkes put the entire investigation of sex drive and \ndominance-subordination explicitly in the context of pressing contemporary \ndebates. Yerkes assumed that feminism was equivalent to the proposition \nthat males and females were biologically 'equa]'; that is to say, he assumed \nthat the concept of rights in political philosophy was properly rooted in \nnatural economy. On 'scientific grounds', Yerkes firmly rejected the pro-\nposition that males were mentally superior, or, for that matter, naturally \ndominant. Males and females had the same psychological (ideation) and \ndrive (motivation) structure. But as a consequence of hormonal structures \nthere were differences in expression of drives. The result was personality. \nLife science required a physical marker for the internal state. Yerkes' work \narticulated the relation of psychobiology to contemporary biology and \nphysiology of sex, the first two categories of the Committee for Research on \n. Problems of Sex's promotional programme. If the division of labour in \nsociety could be correlated with the differences in drive expression, then the \nfeminists of Yerkes' time were misguided (Yerkes, '943, p. 69)· \n'Many clear-cut sex contrasts appear in the varied and complex expres-\nsions of dominance and subordination, leadership and control, aggression \n",

To these,' Yerkes (1943, p. 71) wrote, 'as uniquely importaot in \nthe further description of masculinity and femininity, attention is especially \ninvited.' In the context of discussing differentiated techniques of social \ncontrol adopted by males and females, Yerkes described biologically deter-\nmined differences in drive expression. The existence of chimpanzee differ-\nences in 'techniques of social control' suggested that human modes were \nalso psychobiologically legitimated and inevitable. \nIn a word, the masculine behavior is predominantly self-distracting; the \nfeminine, primarily favor-currying and priority-seeking ... To the \nobserver the male seems often to be trying hard to blot out awareness of \nhis subordination; the female, by contrast, to be hopefully trying to induce \nthe male to give place to her at the chute ... As for the females, wiles, \ntrickery, or deceitful cunning, which are conspicuous by their absence in \nthe male list, are favorite resources. But even more so are sexual allure \nand varied forms of solicitation ... That the female is, chameleon-like, a \ncreature of multiple personality, is clear from our observations. (Yerkes, \n'943, p. 83) \nYerkes based these 'observations' on the experimental sociology of the food \nchute test. He did not leave the lesson for the limits of cultural formation of \npersonality, and therefore of possible social change, to the imagination: \nI am impressed by the contrasted attitudes and activities revealed by the \ncompetitive food situation, and I offer them as evidence that male and \nfemale chimpanzees differ as definitely and significantly in behavioral \ntraits as in physique. I am not convinced that by reversal of cultural \ninfluences the pictures characteristic of masculinity and femininity can be \nreversed. (Yerkes, '943, p. 85) \nThis opinion should be evaluated in light of Yerkes' extraordinary belief in \nhuman malleability and perfectibility through engineering. 'Personality \ndifferences' should be managed, not foolishly denied. \nYerkes believed the personality studies using anthropoid material were \nespecially favourable because of the absence of social taboos and personal \ninhibitions. \nTherefore, I submit that such observational items as appear in this report, \nand in related studies of the psychology of sex in the anthropoid apes, \nshould have exceptional value for those who concern themselves with. \nproblems of social behavior, and, especially at this juncture, for those \npsychopathologists who are intent on appraising, perfecting, and using \npsychoanalytical methods of observation and interpretation.

Personality \nmeant the functional whole, 'the product of integration of all the psycho-\nbiological traits and capacities of the orgattism'. In a normal personality, \ninherited characteristics and basic organic drives were integrated with the \nconscious self. In sum, personality was an absolutely central scientific object \nfor life and human science. To have a masculine or feminine personality was \nnot a minor matter; on its proper development hinged the adjustroent and \nhappiness of the individual and the body politic. Yerkes did not want to \nunderestimate diversity and variability. Comparative science was designed \nprecisely to deal scientifically with variability. For drives as central as sex and \ndominance and for expressions as consequential as masculinity and feminin-\nity, nurture of personality was a matter for responsible scientific service. The \npossibility of prescription of social role on rational grounds was at stake. If \ndrives and personality could be measured early, proper treatroem could be \ninitiated. Yerkes was cautious, but hopeful. \nIf in man dominance as personality trait is highly correlated positively \nwith leadership, as it evidently is in chimpanzee; if it is a condition of or \nmarkedly favorable to individual initiative, inquiringness, inventiveness, \nand creativeness; and if, further, it should prove to be reliably measurable \nduring childhood, it may very well come to possess conspicuous value as \nindicator of vocational aptitudes and social usefulness and therefore also \nas the basis for differential educational treatroem and occupational \nchoice. Even marital advice might be affected by it, for congeniality or \nsocial fitness may depend appreciably upon similarity or the reverse in \ndominance as personality trait of mates or companions. (Yerkes, '939, \np. 133)· \nIt is significant that the culture concept depended on personality in the \nanthropology of the 1930s. We have moved with Yerkes from instinct, \nthrough personality, to culture, to human engineering. Scientists themselves \ninterwove sex, mind, and society in a vocation of scientific service estab-\nlishing a promising new life science of comparative primate psychobiology, \nreaching from learning through motivation to experimental sociology. \nPrimatology served as a mediator between life and human sciences in a \ncritical period of reformulation of the doctrines of nature and culture. Yerkes \nordered his life in the belief this science would serve to foster a higher state \nof individual and social consciousness, the ideological goal of liberal \nhumanism. \nBefore developing the second major section of this chapter, sociobiology, \nit is worth returning from Yerkes' mature positions in the late 1930S on \n",

He began with a call to 'look confidently to \ndisinterested research to guide our race to a wise solution' of the problem of \nwhether 'the industrial system and its products [shall] be treated as ends or \nmeans to human welfare' (Yerkes, 1922, p. 56). He saw personnel research, \nthe study of the human factor of production, as the key discipline of the new \nera. 'There is every reason to believe that human engineering will shordy \ntake its place among the important forms of practical endeavor' (p. 57). \nYerkes believed that industrial systems had evolved from slavery, to the wage \nsystem, to the present system based on co-operation and that only now could \nthe value of the person be realized. Because personnel research took the \nperson as the proper unit of production, that discipline led the way to the \nscientific nurture of intelligent co-operation to replace class strife between \nlabour and maladaptive, evolutionarily out-moded laissez-faire capitalism. \nYerkes and his liberal peers advocated studying traits of the body, mind, \nspirit, and character in order to fit 'the person' perfectly into the proper place \nin industry. Equality clearly did not mean organic sameness; therefore it \nmust mean that 'in the United States of America, within limits set by age, \nsex, and race, persons are equal under the law and may claim as their right as \ncitizens like opportunities for human service and responsibility' (Yerkes, \n1922, p. 58). \nBy Yerkes' logic, equality was everyone's right to occupy one's natural \nplace determined by disinterested science. Differences were the essential \nsubject Jor the new science. Personnel research would provide reliable \ninformation for the employment manager and proper vocational counselling \nfor the 'person'. The 'vocations' themselves were regarded as neutral \nproducts of industrial progress so that the problem was simply one of human \ninventory in a democracy. The unit of analysis was the person, transformed \nby the scientific concept of personality which tied physiology, medicine, \npsychology, anthropology, and sociology into the service of management. \nFurther, 'the person', and 'personality', retained a strong anti-materialist \nmeaning at the same time that the associated ideology permitted scientific \nreduction by objective methods -\nlike intelligence testing, motivational \nresearch, and sexual psychobiology. The wedding of philosophical idealism \nand natural science produced well-behaved modem children in the factory \nand the home. In short, '[I]ndustry now has abundant opportunity to develop \nsuitable methods of measuring persons with respect to qualities of character, \nmind, and body, and to make this information immediately available in \n",

The harmony of \nself and social management hinged on capitalist doctrines of personality. \nSatisfaction of basic instincts, themselves known through science, was the \neSsence of self-expression in this model. Science, not class conflict, could \nprovide for further human adaptive evolution. To be socially useful the drive \nhad to be a kind of organic instinct compatible with the biological evolution \nof co-operation that was at last finding adequate industrial development. \nYerkes logically collapsed the scientific object of personality into the spiritual \nvalue of the person: 'It now remains for personnel research to effect a still \nmore significant and beneficial revolution or reformation [than the invention \nof machines] by making available adequate knowledge of man in all his \nessential aspects and relations, and by bringing into clear relief the supreme \nvalue of the person' (1922, p. 63).

By the mid-\n'930s, Yerkes' psychobiology, as well as the research programmes of many \nof his peers, was in trouble at the Rockefeller Foundation. Warren Weaver, \nthe new head of the Division of Natural Sciences, had quite a different vision \nof the future of biology and of engineering as a life science. Weaver was both \nan instrument and a sign of much larger forces. J7 By the early '960s, the \ncommunications revolution was established in power; its effects can be \nfollowed in biology in four revealing, collective, authoritative texts, culminat-\ning in a well-published, state-of-the-art introductory biology text by E. O. \nWilson and his colleagues.18 The themes of machine and market in the \nconstitution of capitalist life science recur in the work of Wilson (born '929, \nPhD from Harvard '955) and his many peers. Sociobiology is a communica-\ntions science, with a logic of control appropriate to the historical conditions \nof post-Second World War capitalism. \nThe communications revolution changed the strategy of control from \norganism to system, from eugenics to population management, from person-\nnel management to organization structures (sociotechnical systems and \nergonomics) based on operations research (Lilienfeld, '978, ch. 4). A \ncommunications revolution means a re-theorizing of natural objects as \ntechnological devices properly understood in tertns of mechanisms of \nproduction, transfer, and storage of information. Changes in the technology \nof actual communications systems provided part of the material foundation \nof fundamental scientific reformulations. War and problems of military \nmanagement encouraged new developments in science. Operations research \nbegan with the Second World War and efforts to co-ordinate radar devices \nand infortnation about enemy position in a total or systems way, which \nconceived of the human operator and the physical machinery as the unified \nobject of analysis. Statistical models were increasingly applied to problems of \nsimulation and prediction for making key decisions. After the war, the \nexplosive development of electronics industries and communications tech-\nnology was increasingly tied to strategies of social and military planning to \ndevise and manage stable systems organized around several axes of \nvariation. 19 Knowledge about range of variation and interaction effects \namong classes of variables replaced concern for individual. states. The \ncomputer, a communications machine, both effected and symbolized new \nstrategies of control. \nLet us grant that communication means control - but for what? And does \nthat particular goal really allow the labelling of whole scientific structures as \ncapitalist in any deep way? Without suggesting a final answer to the second \nquestion, let us look at the first.

The range ofintertnediate \nstructures between extraction of surplus value and realization of profit \nrequired a whole set of discourses and technologies that constituted the \ncommunications revolution. \nNo natural or human science has been unaffected by these technical and \ntheoretical transfortnations. Precisely how each scientific discourse relates to \nthese historical changes is a matter for detailed study; it is certain the \nconnections wiII not often be direct or simple.20 But it is a striking fact that \nthe forroal theory of nature embodied in sociobiology is structurally like \nadvanced capitalist theories of investment management, control systems for \nlabour, and insurance practices based on population disciplines. Further-\nmore, sociobiology, like all modem biologies, studies a control machine as its \ncentral object. Nature is structured as a series of interlocking cybernetic \nsystems, which are theorized as communications problems. Nature has been \nsystematically constituted in tertns of the capitalist machine and market. Let \nus look first at the market. \nThe market is best approached in tertns of the history of the concept of \nnatural selection. Contemporaries realized that a Darwinian natural eco-\nnomy, the competitive struggle of all against all for profit, suggested \ntroubling parallels to political economy. Darwin himself realized his debt to \nThomas Malthus; scarcily was the motor of nature as well as of history \n(Malthus, '798, pp. 26--30, 73-5, 98). Biological populations increased at a \nrate that guaranteed pertnanent scarcily, as well as pertnanent technical \nimprovement in the means of production. Progress and scarcily were the \ntwin forces in capitalist deve1opment.21 Reproduction of biological organ-\nisms seemed the basic process in both nature and history, and reproduction \nwas inherently competitive. Scarcily seemed inevitably linked to a natural \nprocess, and not to a historical limiting fartn of appropriation of the product \nof human production. Reproduction, not production, seemed the proper \nfocus for a natural science of sociely. Similarly, as Marx noted, bourgeois \npolitical economists focused on equal and competitive exchange in the \nmarket, while obscuring the relations of domination in production. Those \nrelations were enforced by particular mechanisms (including technology) \nwhich were designed to transfer the locus of control away from the worker. \nAll of this is familiar. From this point of view, sociobiology is merely an \nextension and development of the theory of natural selection. \nSociobiology (Wilson, '975, p. 10) is a biological understanding of groups \n- societies and populations. As for all capitalist science, the fundamental \nproblem needing explanation is the combination of individuals for the \ncommon good.

Altruism in sociobiology \nis defined as 'self-destructive behavior performed for the benefit of others' \n(Wilson, '975, p. 578). How could individuals profit in the long run, if they \nwasted time and courted danger in self-destructive generosity? The problem \nseemed particularly acute in the most advanced natural societies - social \ninsects and non-human primates, not to mention human orders. Sociobiolo-\ngy's solution is the quantitatively sophisticated extension of natural selection \nand population genetics, producing the notion of 'inclusive fitness: the sum \nof an individual's own fitness plus all its influence on fitness in its relatives \nother than direct descendants; hence the total effect of kin selection with \nreference to an individual' (Wilson, '975, p. 586). \nThe ideas related to inclusive fitness - kin selection, seXl,al selection, \nparental investnIent - permitted a refocusing of an old argument; that is to \nsay, at what level can selection occur (Wynne-Edwards, '962; Trivers, '97 I, \n1972)? In particular, can the social group be the locus of selection? If so, is \nthe group a kind of superorganism, physiologically as well as genetically \nanalogous to an individual? The answer for sociobiology is no.22 Or rather, \nthose suggestions no longer make sense. The genetic calculus of sociobiolo-\ngy concerns maximization strategies of genes and combinations of genes. All \nsorts of phenomenal orders are possible, from asexual individuals to \ncast-structured insect societies with only one reproductive pair, to role-\ndiversified societies with many reproducing members. None of these orders \nis the central object of concern. That noumenal object is the gene, called by \nRichard Dawkins the 'replica tor' , within the gene pool. Sociobiology \nanalyses all behaviour in terms of the ultimate level of explanation, the \ngenetic market place. \nBodies and societies are only the replica tors' strategies for maximizing \ntheir own reproductive profit. Apparent co-operation of individuals may be a \nperfectly rational strategy, iflong-term cost-benefit analyses are made at the \nlevel of the genes. Such analyses call for the development and application of \nmathematical tools directly related to political economy and the technical \ndemands made by that science. The novel dimension in late twentieth-\ncentury political and natural economy is the shared problem of understand-\ning very complex forms of combination, which obscure the competitive \nbedrock of capitalism with phenomena like altruism and liberal corporate \nresponsibility in transnational enterprises. \nIn 'nature' profit is measured in the currency of genes, and reproduction \nor replication is the natural imperative. But reproduction is not sex. In fact, \nsex is a dangerous modem innovation, one so challenging to older logics of \nindividual profit-making as to require considerable attention. Like any other \ncapitalist system, natural replication systems are compelled to make radical \ninnovations all the time, or be outclassed by the dynamic competition. Sex is \n",

Societies can be rationalized by probing the consequences \nof individual advantage and inclusive fitness, but the most highly integrated \nsocieties, the insects, minimize the disruptive effects of sex. Sex is a \nconstraint on the formation of societies because sexually reproducing \nindividuals are not identical genetically. They therefore compete with \ndifferent investnIent strategies (Wilson, '975, p. 314 fl). \nSo why risk dangerous investnIent strategies? Because they speed innova-\ntion - the rapid production of new genotypes which can respond to \nenvironmental changes or other contingencies. Such diversification maxim-\nizes the chances of long-term success. Through speedy production of new \ngenotypes, not primarily dependent on mutation, reproducers secure a \ncompetitive advantage. Naturally, sociobiology argues, there will be some \ncircumstances in which the dangers of sexual competition outweigh the \nadvantages of rapid diversification. Sociobiology aims at a quantitative \nassessment of appropriate strategies. If sex ceases to provide an edge, it will \nhave to go. But any society with most of its members engaging in sexual \nreproduction cannot hope for real peace. The best to be anticipated is a \nhannonious management of competing investment strategies, in such a way \nthat the system as a whole (natural evolution) is preserved. \nA consequence of this analysis of sex is the attention given to competing \ninterests of males and females in reproduction. Some of the best work on \nparental investnIent strategies has been done on birds, allowing an under-\nstanding of such issues as clutch size and male and female differences in \nbehaviour (especially readiness to mate).23 The claim has been made that \nsociobiology establishes the ultimate equality of males and females by \nshowing that they compete equally - if by different strategies - in the only \ngame that counts, amassing genetic profit. The different strategies are a \nfunction of the different energetic commitnIent to reproduction that the \nsexes make. Mates must regard each other as means of capital accumulation \nnot reliably under control. The sex which commits huge energy resources to \nincubating and nurturing will develop coy behaviour and adopt a sceptical \nstance towards errant mates. These fundamental behaviours would almost \ncertainly be genetically mandated and constrained (Dawkins, 1976). \nIn advertising Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's book on langur behaviour, in which \nshe emphasized competitive reproductive strategies of males and females, \nHarvard University Press referred to that kind of natural history as feminist \n(Ford, 1976; Hrdy, 1977). It would be hard to find a more market-limited \nrationale for feminist political theory. Much of the application of sociobiolo-\ngy to human beings centres around sexual competition (Weinrich, 1977)' \nBut let us leave the market, despite its wealth of unexplicated topics, and \nJook at sociobiology's theorizing of nature as a communications or control \nmachine.

The genes must make stable \nmediating devices; that is, they must produce machines embodying evolution-\nary stable strategies, just as capital requires capitalist institutions. Without \nmechanisms for transmission and replication, the genes are like hoarded \nmoney. The market demands a technology of production consistent with i~ \nown imperatives. Here we leave the realm of competition and exchange and \nenter the factories of life. What kind of mediating machines do the genes \ninform? Naturally, cybernetic systems. \nSociobiology studies two fundamental sorts of systems: populations and \nsocieties. Both are studied in terms of boundaries ofinformation and energy \nflow. Information and energy are different faces of a common coin, a \nrealization made possible by thermodynamics and information sciences. \nPopulations are measured in terms of boundaries of gene flow over time; \ngenes are materializations of information. Sociobiology studies societies in \nterms of zones of communication and exchange of information (Wilson, \n1971, p. 224 ff; '975, ch. 1). Individuals are systems common to sociobiolo-\ngy and other areas of life science. Individuals also are studied as part of \nstructured flows of information and energy, interacting with other indi-\nviduals; higher levels of order (societies, populations) result. Individuals are \nintermediate structures constructed, or rather instructed, by the genes. \nWhat the genes really make are behaving machines. Thus behaviour \nbecomes a central concern of sociobiology. Behaviour is the evolutionary \npacemaker; it determines the rate of system change by ilS capacity to track \nand respond to variables. Dawkins, in his chapter 'The Gene Machine', \ndiscusses behaviour in terms of motion timed and controlled by a biological \ncomputer whose least element is the neurone (Dawkins, 1976, pp. 49-70). \nGenes are like programs for chess-playing computers; that is, genes build \nbrains, effector organs, and sensory channels. Brains are processing devices \nwith logical programs. Terms like 'imagination' (all mentalistic language) \nrefer to forms of simulation made possible by advanced brains. The task of \nbrains is the prediction of interlocking system contingencies, including the \nenvironment, and control of rate of motion. The system goal is maximization \nof genetic profit, necessitating the structuring of specific forms of control. \nSpeed and capacity of processing are the basic parameters of the brain as \ncontrol de,;ce. \nWilson (1975, ch. 7) calls social behaviour a traclting device for changes in \nthe environment. He elaborates the concept of multi-level, hierarchically \ndesigned tracking systems. Relating the appropriate tracking mechanisms to \nthe appropriate time scale, he works 'down' from levels of evolutionary \nadaptation (including morphogenetic changes and a hierarchy of organismic \n'responses', from instinct-reflex systems to generalized learning systems) to \nindividual adaptations (including learning, socialization, and play).

The question is which level of \ntracking device one is considering. \nThe important point to keep in mind is that such phenomena as the \nhormonal mediation of behavior, ontogenetic development of behavior, \nand motivation ... are really only selS of adaptations keyed to environ-\nmental change of different durations. They are not fundamental prop-\nerties of organisms around which the species must shape its biology ... \nThe phenomena cannot be generally explained by searching for limiting \nfeatures in the adrenal cortex, vertebrate mid-brain, or other controlling \norgans, for the reason that these organs have themselves evolved to serve \nthe requirements of special multiple tracking systems posessed by \nparticular species. (Wilson, 1975, p. 145) \nSo, physiology is subordinate to another level of analysis, that of operations \nresearch directed at biological tracking devices much more sensitive than \nradar. This approach to behaviour, adaptation, and the brain, in operations \ntermS analogous to those studied in the Second World War, stands in sharp \ncontrast to Yerkes' psychobiological doctrines of mind, brain, and society. \nBiological inventory and personnel management have been superseded. The \ndistance is large between persons or superorganisms (the mind co-ordinates \nsexual instinct to produce co-operation) on the one hand, and multiple \ntracking systems (with mind as the strategy of genes) on the other hand. \nCommunications theory is closely related to the sociobiological treatment \nof behaviour. From operations research to information sciences is a short \nstep. Communication is sending and receiving meaningful signals, resulting \nin changed probabilities of behaviour. According to Wilson (1975, p. 201) a \ntask of his science is to construct 'zoosemiotics'; that is, the study of general \nproperties of communication.\" Basic to that task is an analysis of modes of \ncommunication, which necessitates attention to sensory channels, whether \nauditory, tactile, acoustical, or chemical. \nIt is therefore legitimate to analyze advantages and disadvantages of the \nseveral sensory modalities as though they were competing in an open \nmarketplace for the privilege of carrying messages. Put another, more \nfamiliar way, we can reasonably hypothesize that species evolve toward \nthe mix of sensory cues that maximizes either energetic or informational \nefficiency, or both. (Wilson, '975, p. 23 1) \nIt is in this context that we should consider one of Wilson's most important \nresearch contributions to sociobiology: a study of insect chemical com-\nmunication mediated by pheromones. Pheromones are chemical substances, \nusually glandular in origin. 'One individual releases the material as a signal \nand another responds after tasting or smelling it' (1975, p. 591). Social \n",

In about 1958, Wilson (1962; 1971, \nchs 12-14) adapted a mathematical technique to measure the amount of \ninformation transmitted by the fire ant odour trails and to compare it with \nthe amount transmitted by the waggle dance of the honey bee. The general \nproject was the translation of behaviour of all sorts into bits which could be \ntreated by conventional information theory relating energy, capacity, noise, \nambiguity, and so on. Wilson's goal was to understand communication as \npan of hierarchically graded evolutionary stable strategies, differentiated by \ntime scale and material modality, in the interest of genetic fitness or \nmaximization of genetic profit. \nTerritoriality and dominance systems are modes of communication which \nmaintain stable configurations over intermediate time spans (Wilson, '975, \nchs 12-13). Aggression, a form of competition, is basically a type of \ncommunication which must be analysed in terms of functional content and \nenergetic efficiency. In principle, if found wanting by the evolutionary \nengineer, aggression, like sex, is dispensable. This is very unlikely; but \noutmoded expressions of aggression should be expected, providing models \nfor social and psychological therapy in human orders. Obsolescence is a \ncentral theme in the biology of automated technological devices. The \ncontrast with Yerkes' organismic psychobiology culminating in the person is \nevident. For a sociobiologist, dominance is not a trait, nor even an individual \norganismic predisposition, but a system propeny. The type of engineering \nintervention appropriate to sociobiology is systems analysis and design, not \nclinical diagnosis based on an analogy to physiology and scientific medicine. \nBut both forms of engineering argue for a special role for the scientific \nexpen in designing history (systems) on the human level. \nThe point of systems design is optimization. Optimization does not mean \nperfection. A system has to be good enough to survive under given \nconditions. Nature can be lazy, and seems to have abandoned a natural \ntheological project of adaptive perfection. Yerkes sought to fmd perfection in \nadaptivity, but not the sociobiologists. Optimization does not mean max-\nimum productive efficiency at all times. Insects in optimized societies can be \nlazy as well as industrious; it has been precisely measured. Crucial to system \noptimization are the mass effects of many variables, not perfection of the \nindividual worker ant. So, Taylorite scientific management is inappropriate \nas an analogue to modem scientific study of the natural economy. \nIn the early 1960s, Wilson drew on the systems science of ergonomics that \nhad been developed in human sociology of capitalist production.

Wilson appl~ed \nergonomic analysis to the problem of number, type, and nmmg of producllOn \nof various castes in insect societies, in order 'to analyze optimality'. Such an \nanalysis should reveal when and how many sexually reproducing forms will \nbe found under particular environmental conditions for a given species. \nFirst consider the concept of cost in colony reproduction ... The mature \ncolo~y, on reaching its predetemIined size, can be expected to contain \ncaste ratios that approximate the optimal mix. This mix is simply the rallO \nof castes that can achieve the maximum rate of production of virgin \nqueens and males while the colony is at or near its maximum size. It is \nhelpful to think of a colony of social insects as operating somewhat like a \nfactory constructed inside a fonress ... [the] colony must send foragers \nout to gather food while converting the secured food inside the nest into \nvirgin queens and males as rapidly and efficiently as possible. The rate of \nproduction of the sexual forms is an imponant, but not an exclusive, \ncomponent of colony fimess.

Yerkes' terms of reference have \nno place in the new biology of optimized communications systems assessed \nby a design engineer. The disquieting aspect of all this is that sociobiologists \ncan and have correctly predicted insect caste distributions with these \nanalyses. \nWilson concluded the chapter in Sociobiology on origins and evolution of \ncommunications by drawing attention to the central aspect of biology as an \nengineering science; that is, a science that studies systems design, with an \neye to human-mediated improvement of potentially outmoded natural \ncontrol systems. 'If the theory of natural selection is really correct, an \nevolving species can be metaphorized as a communications engineer who \ntries to assemble as perfect a transmission device as the materials at hand \npermit' (1975, p. 240). Phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of natural \nsystems could, in the human case, be studied and perhaps redesigned. There \nwould, however, be limits to design, limits crucial from a human political \nperspective that denies a natural necessity for hierarchical control systems \nand other modes of domination, for example, socialist-feminism. \nThe theoretical view of nature underlying genetic engineering and \nbioethics as a kind of quality control industry appears clearly in sociobiology. \n",

The \nhumanism of sociobiology, which Wilson correctly cites in his defence, is \nprecisely the core of his science's sexism.27 In addition of course, sociobiolo-\ngical reasoning applied to human societies easily glides into facile naturaliza-\ntion of job segregation, dominance hierarchies, racial chauvinism, and the \n'necessity' of domination in sexually based societies to control the nastier \naspects of genetic competition.

One thing is \nundeniable about biology since its early formulations in the late eighteenth \nand early nineteenth centuries: biology tells tales about origins, about \ngenesis, and about nature. Further, modern feminists have inherited our \nstory in a patriarchal voice. Biology is the science of life, conceived and \nauthored by a word from the father. Feminists have inherited knowledge \nthrough the paternal line.

To author is to have the power to originate, \nto name. Women who seek to produce natural knowledge, like our sisters \nwho learned to write and speak, also must decipher a text, the book of \nnature, authored legitimately by men. \nGilbert and Gubar, analysing the extraordinary influence of Milton's \njustification of the ways of God on nineteenth-century female writers \nseeking to tell stories, suggest that all of us begin in some sense as Milton's \ndaughters, forced to read a book in a language that signifies our lack, our \ndifference. Tize Madwoman in tlze Attic asserts that Milton's literary daughters \nadopted two main strategies for gaining authority: they either reinterpreted \nthe origin story to get it right the second time, or they rebelliously \nproclaimed a totally new story. In deep similarity, feminists taking respons-\nibility for modern origin stories - that is, for biology - may try to get the story \nright, to clean up shoddy science about evolution and brains and hormones, \nto show how biology really comes out right with no conflict between reason \nand authority. Or feminists may more boldly announce a completely new \nbirth. In both cases, feminists are contesting for a voice. And so rhetorical \nstrategies, the contest to set the terms of speech, are at the centre of feminist \nstruggles in natural science. The four books discussed in this chapter may be \nread primarily as entries in the contest of rhetorical strategies for setting the \nterms that define good science. How should we know whom to believe? After \nexamining these four books, the stories they tell, and the modes of telling \nthey adopt in their attempt to prove authority, we may return to the questions \nof the opening paragraph with a new ear. \nLet us begin at the beginning.

Most \nimportant, Barash wishes to establish that Darwin be.gat sociobiology \nthrough his sons, especially men like himself, Robert Tnvers, .and W. D. \nHamilton.

J). He reiterates \nthat sociobiology aims only to provide perspective for formulating the highest \nsocial goals, for bridging the two cultures, science and humanities. David \nBarash, his authority to speak acknowledged by his invitation to this \nexpensive, taxpayer-supported forum, provides a manifesto for a scientiflc \nrevolution and exclaims over the 'epiphantic insights' of the cost-beneflt \ntheorists in the history of sociobiology (p. 1 J). Sociobiologist Pierre L. van \nden Berghe preaches to the derelict social sciences and argues that only a \nreturn to the pastures of biology will reroot the human sciences in the soil of \ntruth; history of science shows it. Sherwood Washburn scathingly chastises \nsociobiology for ruining social science by biologizing; his history of science \nshows the necessity of social explanation for social facts? Physicist and \nhistorian of the physical sciences Gerald Holton, whose authority to speak \nmust derive from his association with the most real of sciences (he notes in \nthe flrst paragraph that he checked his pronouncemenlS about biology with \nthe relevant experts), praises sociobiology because it 'takes risks' and 'throws \ndown the challenge' (pp. 75, 79). In short, sociobiology has proper male \nattributes. Holton proceeds to talk about the lineage of Ernst Haecke!, \nJacques Loeb, Lucretius, and, of course, Newton. The point is to assess \nwhether sociobiology measures up to the standards of a new synthesis. \nAnimal psychologist Frank Beach argues persuasively that real science has \nmore to say about proximate mechanisms and detailed empirical investiga-\ntion and eschews easy ultimate claims and premature risky theory. Compar-\ning the history of evolutionary biology and phrenology, historian-philosopher \nDavid Hull disclaims any pronouncements on the truth of scientific theories \nand points out that judgements of history have to do with success - who \nmarshals resources to stay in the game and so by definition practises good \nscience.

Genes and Gender \nconcludes that such research is now impossible - it simply cannot measure \nup to standards of scientific knowledge. This group of feminists has set out \nto name the rules of enquiry. And Star speaks in this group not as a Nobel \nPrize winner or as a tenured sociobiologist at a major university claiming \nDarwin's mantle, if not Newton's. She speaks as an editor of poetry for \nSillister Wisdom and as a graduate student in geriatrics who studied research \non brain asymmetry in an undergraduate seminar at Radcliffe, an institution \nthat has led many women to authority. The authors in Genes and Gender try to \npersuade researchers to accept new standards, indeed, to abandon their \nfield, in a way analogous to a physicist's telling biologists that anything they \ncannot quantifY does not qualifY as the matter of science. It remains a \nquestion whether natural selection and evolutionary biology itself would not \nhave to abandon the field in the face of enforcement of that standard. What \nleads the authors in Genes and Gender to reach their nihilistic conclusion? \nFirst, they cite the ubiquity of ' bad science' in the field of sex differences.s \nThis strategy emerges from the historical necessity for feminists to begin \nwith the heritage of names in a patriarchal voice. We are obliged to comment \non the received texts. After all, one does not start from scratch when John \nMoney has the gender clinic, E. O. Wilson the professorship at the Museum \nof Comparative Zoology, and so on. Milton's feminist daughters are as \nconcerned about lineages as Barash, Holton, or Hardin. The strategy of \nreinterpretation of received stories is widely used by the authors in this book. \nIn the 'begats' as presented by these authors, Darwin and Galileo become \nanti-heroes who either scientized Victorian social prejudice or alienated the \nsubject from the object in a doctrine of the primacy of quantifiable qualities \n(pp. 15-17). The critique of bad science leads directly to an analysis of the \nmaterial conditions of the production of knowledge and to a personal \nidentification of the objective voice behind the 'pure, unadulterated facts'. \nReality has an author. The author always has a proper name, but it has a way \nof disappearing into declarative sentences or even graphs embedded in \npublished papers issuing from well-funded laboratories'\" \nThrough these kinds of analyses, the authors in Gmes and Gender want to \npersuade us that the bad science did not emerge accidentally, but \nsystematically - and further, mllst continue to emerge, no matter how much \nindividual scientists try to do good science on sex and gender. Facts are \ntheory-laden; theories are value-laden; values are history-laden. And the \nhistory in this case makes it impossible for any researcher to step far enough \naway from daily, lived dominations of gender to study gender with any \nauthority.

The constitution of sex \nand gender as privileged objects of knowledge is a tool in the search for the \nself. This construction regenerates the infinite regress of the search for the \nillusive subject that paradoxically ends regularly in the discovery of the \ntotalitarian object - nature, the gene, the word. \nThese are strong words, and their difficulty is revealed when the feminists \nof Genes and Gf!1Ider want to emerge from agoosticism and say what is the \ncase with sex and gender. Feminists want also to adopt the second strategy of \nMilton's literary daughters and tell truly new stories with authority. But the \ncritique of bad science that glides into a radical doctrine that all scientific \nstatements are historical fictions made facts through the exercise of power \nproduces trouble when feminists want to talk about producing feminisl \nscience which is more Ime, not just better at predicting and controlling the \nbody of the world. David Hull's SUccess story in the NEXA volume (that \nscience becomes official through opportunistic survival) will not do for \nfeminists because they do not wish to adopt the mask of having no position, \nmere spectators on the sidelines of the history of science. Corrosive \nscepticism cannot be midwife to new stories. Naomi Weisstein puts the \nmatter well in Woman Look at Biology when she says, '[E]vidence became a \nhero of mine' {Hubbard el 01., 1979, p. 187).10 \nThe process of exposing bad science, showing the fictive character of all \nscience, and then proposing the real facts results in repeated unexamined \ncontradictions in the feminist essays in both books.

Ruth Hubbard, a kind of scientific mother in the production of both \nGenes and Gender and Women Look at Biology, provides a sophisticated \nanalysis of the issues and also shows clearly some of the contradictions in \nextant feminist analysis of biology. \nIn 'Have only men evolved', Hubbard begins with a thorough critique of \ntheories of representation and ideologies of objectivity in science in general. \nFor humans, language plays a major role in generating reality ... \nHowever, all acts of naming happen against a backdrop of what is socially \naccepted as real. The question is who has social sanction to defme the \nlarger reality into which one's everyday experiences must fit in order that \none be reckoned sane and responsible ...

Next Hubbard provides a nuanced reading \nof male-'engendered' origin stories of human evolution. But then, in the \nmidst of discussing the difficulty of reconstructing the past, she puts in a \nlittle sentence that categorically asserts a fact: 'Since the time when we and \nthe apes diverged some fifteen million years ago, the main features of human \nevolution that one can read from the palaeontological fmds are the upright \nstance, reduction in the size of the teeth, and increase in brain size' (p. 29) \nMaybe, but what are the rules of interpretation that make this story \nunequivocally readable, and how do they differ from the rules for reading \nsocial and behavioural evolution? The main difference seems to be that there \nis now a non-gender-linked agreement about upright stance, so the reading is \nuncontested. But does the end of controversy mean that a story has achieved \nthe status of fact, has escaped social determination, and has become \nobjective? So suggests an innocent declarative sentence in the midst of \nscathing deconstruction. Yet upright stance and times of divergence between \nape and hominid lines have been arenas of mortal combat in evolutionary \ntheory more than once. \nThese problems become acute in the conclusion of the article when \nHubbard suggests tasks for feminists as they take responsibility for the \nproduction of science. In particular, the hidden link between theories of \nrepresentation and the humanist projects of self-discovery causes trouble. \nHubbard cautions that women should not produce mirror-image 'estro-\ncentric' stories, except perhaps as joke and parody. We should sift through \ncurrent work to find raw data. But how, when we have also been told all \nfacts are laden with theory and thus with value and history? We should de-\nmythologize masculinist science; and, able to 'think beyond it, [we] must do \nthe necessary work in the field, in the laboratories, and in the libraries and \ncome up with ways of seeing the facts and of interpreting them' (p. 32). \n'False facts' and 'androcentric science' have endured too long, and a feminist \nscience is necessary for fmding ourselves, for getting our true inheritance. \n'To see our alternatives is essential if we are to acquire the space in which to \nexplore who we are, where we have come from, and where we want to go' \n(p. 32). In short, feminism is a Ime humanism based on Ime knowledge or at \nleast on true interpretation. But all of the epistemological and political \nproblems of humanism and realism are latent - or patent - here. \nFeminists want some theory of representation to avoid the problem of \nepistemological anarchism. An epistemology that justifies not taking a stand \non the nature of things is of little use to women trying to build a shared \npoliticsY But feminists also know that the power of naming a thing is the \npower of objectifYing, of totalizing.

Even those who dismiss such radical talk must \nacknowledge that major refonns of public life and public knowledge are \ncoupled with projects for the purification of language. In the history of \nscience, the fathers of things have been first of all fathers of words - or so the \nstory is told to students of the discipline. Aristotle named beings and thereby \nconstructed the rules oflogic; Bacon denounced Aristotle in a project for the \nrefonn of language so as to permit, at last, true knowledge. Bacon also \nneeded a new logic appropriate to his correct names. Linnaeus legitimated \nthe kinship of human beings with animals in 1758 in the order he named, \nPrimates.

Feminism is, in part, a project for the reconstruction of public life \nand public meanings; feminism is therefore a search for new stories, and so \nfor a language which names a new vision of possibilities and limits. That is, \nfeminism, like science, is a myth, a contest for public knowledge. Can \nfeminists and scientists contest together for stories about primates, without \nreducing both political meanings and scientific meanings to babble? \nI would like to explore the writings of four primatologists linked together \nin a particular social network in physical anthropology, primatologists who \nare also all Euro-American women, in order to probe some aspects of these \nissues. In particular, does the practice of their science by these women in a \nfield of modem biology-anthropology substantially structure discourse in \nways intriguing to feminists? Should we expect anything different from \nwomen than from men? What are the right questions to ask about the place \nof sex and gender in the social structuring of scientific meanings in the areas \nof scientific work under investigation: animal behaviour and evolutionary \ntheory? What questions seem most unhelpful? We will return to look at these \nquestions after following the careers of some of our primate kin, US white \nprimatologists and langurs. \nWhy look through the window of words and stories? Isn't the essence of a \nscience elsewhere, perhaps in the construction of testable propositions about \nnature? But what can count as an object of study? What is a biological object? \nWhy do these objects change so radically historically? Such debates are \ncomplicated; here I would only like to establish the fruitfulness of paying \nclose attention to stories in biology and anthropology, to the common \nstructures of myths and scientific stories and political theories, in such a way \nas to take all these forms seriously. Stories are a core aspect of the \nconstitution of an object of scientific knowledge. I do not wish to reduce \nnatural scientific practice to political practice, or the reverse, but to watch the \nweaving of multi-layered meanings in the social working out of what may \ncount as explanation in an area of biology-anthropology where sex and \ngender seem to matter a great deal. \nThe student of the history of primatology is immediately confronted with a \nrich tapestry of images and stories. For a person formed by a Judaeo-\nChristian mythological inheritance, the extraordinary persistence of the \nGenesis story in scientific reconstructions of human evolution demands \nattention, and not just in the flourish of popular presentations. Equally \nprominent are secular origin stories.2 The history of the relations of science \nand religion is represented on the primate stage, for example, in the contest \nin the early twentieth century for medical rather than moral defmitions of \nsexual behaviour, using animal models (Yerkes, 1943).

Surely the apes, especially \nchimpanzees, and cercopithecines, especially baboons and rhesus monkeys, \nhave most often and most importantly been at the centre of debates about \nhuman evolution, legitimate and illegitimate ways of arguing an animal \nmodel for any human dimension, the nature and significance of primate \nsocial organization, and the impact of gender on the social construction of \nfacts and theories (Fedigan, 1982)? Perhaps this was true, until the question \nofinfanticide emerged at the centre of the debate about langur social life and \nevolution (Ford, 1976). Why and when do langur males killlangur babies? \nWhat should these acts be called? What should the rules be for reliable \nobservation of such acts? Do they really occur? What shall have the social \nstatus of fact and of scientific explanation? These are the questions internal \nto a little comer of primatology which provoked the focus of this chapter. \nWhy and how did these questions come to be crucial to technical discourse \nby the late 1970S? A response to that question will lead us back to an \nexploration of scientific practice as the social production of important public \nstories. \nFirst, however, let us remember tllat evolutionary biology in the \nnineteenth and twentieth centuries is part of the public debate about the \nhuman place in nature - that is, about the nature of politics and society. \nPrimate social behaviour is studied inescapably as part of the complex \nstruggle in liberal Western democracies to name who is a mature, healthy \nciti2enand why.

Further, I want to argue that primate stories, popular and \nscientific, echo and rest on the material social processes of production and \nreproduction of human life. In particular, primate bioanthropology from the \n'920S has figured prominently in contests in ideology and practice for who \nwill control the human means of reproduction, as well as in contests over the \ncauses and controls of human war, and struggles over technical ingenuity \nand co-operative capacities in family and factory. These generalizations, I \nbelieve, are true whether or not particular primate scientists intend their \nwork to be part of such struggles; their stories are part of the public resource \nin the contests. And primatologists tell stories remarkably appropriate to \ntheir times, places, genders, races, classes - as well as to their animals. \nA series of quick illustrations must suffice for the longer argument, if we \nare to get on to the missing, maybe murdered, langur babies and to the \nEuro-American women who watch monkeys professionally. During the \n'920S, in the hands of psychobiologists, comparative psychologists, and \nreproductive and neural physiologists, primates in laboratories figured \nprominently in debates about human mental function and sexual organiza-\ntion. Marriage counselling, immigration policy, and the testing industry all \nare directly indebted to primates and primatologists, who in Robert Yerkes' \nwords were 'servants of science'. Primates seemed models of natural \nco-operation unobscured by language and culture. During the '930s, in \nearly field work on wild primates, the sexual physiology of natural co-\noperation (in the fonns of dominance of males over females and of troop \ndemographic structure) emerged in arguments about human social thera-\npelltiis for social disorder - like labour strikes and divorce. Primate models \nof nuclear families and of fathering in the suburbs, as well as of the doleful \nresults of absent mothers, appeared in public debates about US social \nproblems throughout the 1950S and 1960s. Primate models for human \ndepression have been avidly sought, and a great deal of technical ingenuity \nhas gone into reliably producing psychoses in monkeys. Population policy \nand questions about population regulation drew on primate studies, as did \npsychiatry (even proposed telemetric control) of stressed, perhaps black male \nhuman primates in riotous cities in the '960s. The pressing question of \n'man's' naturally co-operative or warlike nature was argued in symposia and \nclassrooms throughout the Vietnam war, with constant debts to developing \nnew theories of human evolution based on recent fossils from South and \nEast Africa, new field studies of living primates, and the anthropology of \nmodem gatherer-hunters.

But that worry \nquickly embroils the most apolitical scientist in international politics pro-\nfoundly detennined by the history of imperialism. \nIt should surprise no one that langur bioanthropology began to interest a \nwide US public in the 1970S and '980s, when questions about domestic \nviolence (specifically beaten women and children); reproductive freedom (or \noften coercion); abortion; parenting (a euphemism for mothering and an \nambivalent look at fathering); and 'autonomous' women who are not \nprimarily defined in tenns of a social (that is, family) group are prominent. Is \nmothering itself 'selfish'? One cannot but be struck by the plethora of \nfeminist and anti-feminist, biological and homiletic, subtle and blatant \npublishing on human and non-human mothering and on female reproduct-\nive strategies. It is not easy to disentangle the technical and popular threads \nin the langur story in this context, and that disentanglement is in any case a \ncertain ideological move in the interests of saving the purity of science. \nPerhaps for the moment it is more intriguing, even more responsible, to \nleave the weaving tangled and try to sort out the principal arguments about \ninfanticide among the sacred Hanuman monkeys of India. \nPATRILINEAL PRIMATOLOGY: A WAY OF LIFE \nIt is appropriate in biology to begin with descent, with modification, and in \nanthropology with the social object of kinship; so let us approach the subjects \nof this chapter through the fiction of a patriline - that of a very visible father \nin the primate order, Sherwood Washburn. All the women whose work will \nbe examined (Phyllis Jay [later, Dolhinow], Suzanne Ripley, Sarah Blaffer \nHrdy, and Jane Bogess) are academic 'daughters' or granddaughters in an \nimportant network of primatologists in the United States after the Second \nWorld War. It is directly through the Washburn lineage that the langur \nstudents of this story inherited core elements of their fictive strategies, their \nallowable stories, and their tools with which to craft the outlines of a \ndifferent story. Primatology has been a collective historical production, not \nthe offspring of an omnipotent father. But the analyses, entrepreneurial \nactivities, and institutional power of Washburn have grafted primate science \nas a branch of physical anthropology on to roots of modem neo-Darwinian \nevolutionary theory and structural-functional social anthropology. The rules \nof these root sciences must be sketched to follow the debates about langur \nbabies. \nAll the women discussed in this paper have experienced multiple \ninfluences on their work; the fiction of a patriline should connote neither \nunique influence nor necessary hannony.

The language itself \nis charged with questions of independence and indebtedness, of individual \nachievement and ascribed identities. Part of women's struggle against \npatriarchy has been to insist on being named independendy of fathers. My \nuse of family language is intended to suggest problems and tensions, as well \nas to note an ambivalent starting point in present scientific social relations \nhistorically ordered by male-dominant hierarchies. I think there is litde \nquestion that Washburn's professional power has had profound effects for \nhis female and male students. Like any family name, the academic \npatronymic is a social fiction. The language of a patriline does not tell the \nnatural history of an academic family; it names a lineage of struggles, mutual \nconcerns, and inheritance of tools and public social identities. \nThe chief intellectual legacy of the patriline of Washburn's physical \nanthropology was the imperative to reconstruct not fIXed structures, but ways \nof life - to tum fossils into the underpinnings of living animals and to \ninterpret living primates in carefully rule-bound ways as models for aspects \nof human ways of life. Adaptation, function, and action were the real \nscientific objects, not frozen structures or hierarchical, natural scales of \nperfection or complexity. By developing functional comparative anatomy as \npart of the synthetic theory of evolution and extending the approach to the \nsocial behaviour of living primates, Washburn and his students integrated \ngenetic selection theory and disciplined field and experimental methodology \ninto the practice of evolutionary reconstruction. \nThe best-known product of practice in the Washburn patriline was the \n'man-the-hunter' hypothesis of the '9605. This hypothesis suggested that \nthe crucial evolutionary adaptations making possible a human way of life in \nthe hominid line in its likely ecological setting were those associated with a \nnew food-getting strategy, a subsistence innovation carrying the implications \nof a human future based on social co-operation, learned technical skill, \nnuclear families, and eventually fully symbolic language. It is important to \nstress from the beginning that the fundamental elements of the man-the-\nhunter hypothesis guiding much of primate field study for well over a decade \nwere co-operation and the social group as the principal adaptations. \nPhenomena such as aggression, competition, and dominance structures were \nseen primarily as mechanisms of social co-operation, as axes of ordered \ngroup life, as prerequisites of organization. And of course, the man-the-\nhunter hypothesis was pre-eminendy about male ways o£life as the motors of \nthe human past and future. Hunting was a male innovation and speciality, \nthe story insisted. And what was not hunting had always been.

Field and labora-\ntory studies of living primates developed exponentially from modest pre-war \nlevels nearly sinmltaneously and internationally after the Second World War \nfor complex reasons, such as polio research, new fossil hominid finds in \nAfrica, Japanese development of longitudinal studies of primate societies as \npart of comparative anthropology, and searches for animal model systems for \nhuman emotional disorders and social disorganization within a cybernetic \ncontrol model of social management. But these reasons take us beyond the \nconcerns of this essay . Washburn was one of perhaps a dozen key actors in \ndevelopments rooted in large historical determinations like war, new \ntechnologies for international travel and tropical disease control, modem \nmedical research institutionalization, and international conservation organ-\nization in decolonialized but contested neo-imperialist world orders.6 \nWashburn earned his doctorate in physical anthropology at Harvard in \n'940. His training reflected the medical heritage and colonial racist social \nbasis of physical anthropology and primatology. Schooled in traditional \nanthropomorphic methods and primate anatomy, he taught medical anatomy \nat Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons until '947, when he moved \nto the University of Chicago, where he worked with his first important \ngraduate students in social behaviour (as opposed to strict functional \ncomparative anatomy), including Phyllis Jay. Washburn belonged to the \ngeneration of physical anthropologists who disavowed the practice of their \nscience to construct racial hierarchies, a practice of comparative life science \nbased on premises of increasing complexity and perfection in evolution with \nimplicit and explicit teleological standards of white, male, professional, \nbourgeois social organization. Washburn actively contested to move physical \nanthropology away from part of this heritage, primarily by crafting rules for \ntelling evolutionary stories that did not easily yield racist meanings7 He did \nnot see or challenge similar scientific frameworks for knowing and for \nproducing hierarchically ordered gender - not because of personal ill-will, \nbut because world struggles challenging racism were ending colonialism and \nmalting visible many of its rules for generating public knowledge, including \nthe life sciences. The women's movement of the '970S made different \nscientific constructions of gender possible, not the insight of genius in the \nheads of either men or women.

But neither did Washburn and his \nacademic children have direct relations to the social lives of baboons and \nlangurs. The mediations of public stories are multiple. However, we are \nmoving ahead of our story and asserting what must be told. \nBy the mid-1940S Washburn was practising physical anthropology as an \nexperimental science; by 1950 he was developing a powerful programme for \nreinterpreting the basic concepts and methods of his field in harmony with \nthe recent population genetics, systematics, and palaeontology of Theodo-\nsius Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, and George Gaylord Simpson. By 1958 he \nhad a Ford Foundation grant to study the evolution of human behaviour \nfrom multiple points of view, including initial provision for field studies of \nbaboons in East Africa. This work was done in collaboration with his \nstudent, Irven DeVore; it grounds the first development of the baboon \ncomparative model for interpreting hominid evolution from the viewpoint of \nman-the-hunter. In a subsequent National Science Foundation grant \nproposal ('Analysis of Primate Behavior', '96,), DeVore and Washburn \nwere principal investigators, although the grant supported others' work as \nwell. Acknowledging differences from baboon data and interpretations, the \nfmal report to the foundation paid considerable attention to Jay's langur \ninvestigations. Those early grant proposals cited the relevance of the baboon \nsocial behaviour studies to human psychology and psychiatry. Psychiatrist \nDavid Hamburg from NIH and comparative psychologist Harry Harlow \nfrom the University of Wisconsin were among the consultants named in the \nproposals. In '959, at Berkeley, Washburn developed funding for one of the \nfirst primate field stations in the United States. From the beginning of his \ncareer, he lectured, wrote popular texts, made pedagogical mms, reformed \ncurricula on all educational levels, and helped determine the careers of \nprominent figures in evolution and primatology.B \nI am including in the Washburn patriline primate behaviour and evolution \nstudents at the Universities of Chicago and California who earned their \nPhDs after about 1958.

These figures should be placed in \nthe context of very rough preliminary statistics for primatology as a whole. \nThere are three major professional associations to which primate behaviour \nand evolution scientists belong: (I) The International Primatological Society \n(founded 1966) has a membership of about 750, of whom 380 are from the \nUnited States, and 120 (16 per cent) of whom are women.

The \nprincipal rule was to weave stories about function and action, about ways of \nlife. It remains to glance equally quickly at what might be called his 'plan' for \nestablishing authoritative stories about primates. The main element in the \n'plan' was making space for his students to speak, initially covered by his \nsubstantial social authority, but ultimately with their own professional bases. \nAnother principal component in Washburn's training was insistence on what \nwas in 1960 an unusual structure of course and field-lab work for physical \nanthropology. Washburn students, whatever their final concentration, ideally \nstudied functional comparative anatomy, social-cultural theory in social \nanthropology, and field investigations of living primates. Some students did \nnot actually study all three elements, but the ideal was stressed in Washburn \ngrant proposals and other descriptions of his projects for the reform of \nphysical anthropology. Fossils, modem hunter-gatherers, and living pri-\nmates were all necessary to Washburn's programme that produced the \nsynthetic man-the-hunter hypothesis guiding research and informing ex-\nplanatory stories. His students were equipped for leadership roles in an \nemerging discipline. This was a father who knew how to ground an \ninheritance materially. \nWashburn's primatology patrillne may be said to have been born with the \n1957-58 University of Chicago seminar 'Origins of Human Behaviour'. \nMembers of this group, including Phyllis Jay and Irven DeVore, became \nformative figures in evolving primate field studies; and the knowledge of the \nJapanese language of another participant, theJesuit,John Frisch, permitted a \nfuller initial conception of the contemporary work of Japanese colleagues. \nWashburn students were not members of a particularly authoritarian \nlaboratory; they chose their own topics. They also opposed Washburn in \nseveral ways and worked independently of his ideas and support. But several \nreport the sense in retrospect that the intellectual excitement of a new \nsynthesis in physical anthropology and Washburn's nurturance of students' \nchoices and opportunities (as well as indifference to other choices) suggest \nthe existence of a more explicit plan. For example, since functional anatomy \nappropriate to a hunting way of life was an essential part of the story, it \nshould not be surprising to find students in the 1960s working out new \nanatomical adaptational complexes made visible by the man-the-hunter \nhypothesis. Different students could be found studying the hand, vertebral \ncolumn, foot, communication, range and diet, maternal behaviour, and so \non. \nTwo special sessions in the 1960s at the AnIerican Anthropological \nAssociation (AAA) meetings were typical of the social mechanisms which \nWashburn made available to his students and associates and which grounded \nthe man-the-hunter hypothesis firmly in the discipline.

And whatever meanings \nindividual students attached to their own work at the time of their graduate \ntraining, it seems very likely that in the 1960s the public meanings of \npresentations from the University of California, Berkeley, framed by \nWashburn's interpretations -\nand sometimes more active direction -\nincluded: (I) the primacy of the baboon model for a comparative functional \nunderstanding of hominid evolution; (2) the crucial role of the social group \n(and a much lesser role of sexual bonds) as the key behavioural adaptation of \nprimates; and (3) the central drama of a male subsistence innovation _ \nhunting - in the human origin story, which included bipedalism, tools, \nlanguage, and social co-operation. Again, male dominance hierarchies were \na key mechanism of this promising co-operation. \n",

They also often got \nteaching jobs which pennitted time for research and publication. A lengthy \nstory deserves to be told about these primate students, their brothers, and \ntheir tribe (troop?). But here let us turn to only one set of stories authored by \nman-the-hunter's daughters in the field, the langur saga.!! In looking more \nclosely at part of just one complex tale, perhaps we can clarifY how stories \nwith public meanings change within the life sciences. \nOne conclusion of this idiosyncratic exegesis should be announced in \nadvance: the langur story with all its multiple public meanings is not a \nmechanical reflection of ideology and social forces outside physical \nanthropology-primatology; nor is it the product of diligent objective science \never improving its own methods of finally seeing nothing but Ur-monkeys. \nThe natural sciences are neither so tame nor so mystifYing. Both these points \nof view caricature the production of science as myth, that is, as meaning-\nladen public knowledge. But both poles of the caricature contain a \nsuggestion of what I find to be true and what makes the process of crafting \nscience interesting to a person who wonders how new kinds of stories can be \ngiven birth. Natural scientific stories are supposed to be fruitful; they \nregularly lead people who practise science to see things they did not know \nabout before, to find the unexpected. Scientific stories have an intriguing \nrule of construction: in spite of the best precautions, they force an observer \nto see what one cannot expect and probably does not want to see. The tools \nto craft this vision are quite material, even mundane. For example, \nprimatologists over decades have developed and progressively enforced on \neach other quite explicit criteria for collecting data worthy of respect: \nnumber of hours in the field, physical position of observer, ability to \nrecognize animals, inter-observer similarity in naming and counting 'units' \nof behaviour, fonn of data sheets and storage of data, sampling procedures to \ncounter observer preferences to watch what is already interesting, and so on. \nWashburn's patriline provided the children with tools to force provocative \nvision in a historical environment which structured the possibility of different \nstories. The chief problem with arguing this position from the point of view \nof social forces detennining scientific stories from the 'outside' versus \npainstaking scientific practice clearing out bias from the 'inside' is that inside \nand outside are the wrong metaphors. Social forces and daily scientific \npractice both exist inside. Both are part of the process of producing public \nknowledge, and neither is a source of purity or pollution. Indeed, daily \nscientific practice is a very important social force. But such practice can only \nmake vis ',Ie what people can historically learn to see. All stories are multiply \nmediated (Latour and Woolgar, 1979)· \n",

Particular \nmoments in the history of modern primatology and particular papers come \ninto focus here in order to highlight public debates about female human \nnature and about parenting and violence. These debates raise political-\nhistorical questions about scientific origin stories and lead to contests for \nnaming meanings and possibilities, in the contexI of current US struggles to \ndefine and judge human female and male co-operation and competition, \ndomestic violence, abortion and political reproductive freedoms and con-\nstraints, social pathology and stress, and sociobiological arguments about \ninherited tendencies in human social behaviour, including sex roles.

In many \nways primatology was structurally different in the early 1960s from what it \nwas around 1980, when Hrdy and Bogess did their first field work and \npublishing. The size of related literatures, standardization of field pro-\ncedure, dynamics of career social networks and professional possibilities, \nand relations to other debates in biology (for example, within ecology and \npopulation biology) and anthropology (for example, about sociobiology \napplied to human groups) have all changed. A thesis of this chapter is that \nsome of these changes have been a function of, and have in tum contributed \nto, major political struggles over the social relations of human reproduction \nand over the political place of all primate females in nature. \nAt the same time that Jay was in the field watching langurs, her fellow \ngraduate student was watching baboons in Africa. Washburn and Irven \nDeVore conducted a Iz-month, 1,2oo-hour study of baboons in Kenya in \n'959, following up a 2oo-hour preliminary study conducted by Washburn in \n1955, as an almost accidental opportunity at a pan-African conference on \nhuman evolution. The baboon field work explored the power of a scientific \nmodel for certain aspects of reconstructed hominid behavioural adaptational \ncomplexes, postulated to be associated with savannah living and the hunting \ninnovation. Modelling in the Washburn school did not mean searching for a \nsimpler version of a supposedly more complex human behaviour, much less \nsearching for a species considered as a whole to be a simpler version of \nhominids. Scales of complexity were not objects of knowledge here. Other \nprimate species could be models for quite specific aspects of adaptational \ncomplexes, such as range or diet or correlation of intensity of dominance \nhierarchies with predation pressure. Such models, like any other biological \nmodel systems, should be subject to observation and experimental manipula-\ntion in field and laboratory. Logically, primate model systems had the same \nstatus as in vitro or even totally synthetic cell membrane subsystems in \nstudying cell movement. Baboons seemed like promising models in the study \nof human evolution because they were ground-living primates dependent on \na structured social group for survival. Behaviour, ecology, functional \nanatomy - all had to be correlated in any explanatory story. Models could be \nilluminating as contrasts as well as comparisons; model building was part of \nconstruction of a comparative evolutionary science. Indeed, Washburn and \nDeVore (1961) concluded that the differences between baboons and \nhominids were most significant. But there was an explicit centre to all the \ncomparisons: Homo sapiens. In its beginrting, the Washburn school did not \npose the questions of zoologists, but of students of the human way of life. \nAnd baboons emerged early as privileged model systems detemtining \nmeanings for other species studied by Washburn students, for example, \nvervet monkeys and langurs.

Jay's early papers are replete with references to DeVore's story \nabout baboons, a story with a strong plot turning on the life of males, \nespecially in their supposed role as troop protectors, internal peace-keepers, \nand organizers through the mechartism of their dominance hierarchy. \nDeVore literally saw a male-centred baboon troop structure, containing a \ncore of allied dominant males immensely attractive to females and children, \nwith other males on the periphery when the troop was stationary or following \nbehind as special guards when the troop seemed threatened by danger. This \ntableau proved hard for anyone else to see physically, but symbolically it has \nbeen repeated in multiple variations, including textbook illustrations. l2 If \nmale dominance were the mechanism of troop organization, then variations \nin male dominance should be the object of anention to generate comparative \nstories. An implicit corollary was that degrees of social organization were \ncorrelated to fullness of development of that key adaptational mechanism for \nlife in a social group, stable male hierarchies, the germ of co-operation. The \nlogical link to medical-psychiatric therapeutics of social groups should be \nclear: social disorder implies a breakdown of central adaptational mechan-\nisms. Stressed males would engage in inappropriate (excessive or deficient) \ndominance behaviours - at the expense of troop organization and even \nsurvival. \nBoth DeVore and Jay saw the organized social group as the basic adaptive \nunit of the species. This was not necessarily a group selectionist claim, and \nthis issue was hardly raised until sociobiological challenges to (or extensions \nof?) neo-Darwirtian selection theory emerged in the 1970s. Social roles were \nbasic objects of study because they structured groups. Social bonds \nmaintained troop unity, and male dominance relations were hardly the only \nkind of social bond for either observer. But in DeVore's explanations, they \nwere the bonds that ultimately made a group possible; and groups made \nprimates possible, as well as the human way of life, the pre-eminent object of \nknowledge in the Washburn patriline. Note that the important level of \nexplanation is mechanisms and adaptational complexes. Jay's early papers \nshowed a series of fascinating oppositions to this story structure, because her \nlangurs failed to act like good baboons, but still had very stable groups. \nThe bulk of Jay's papers on overall langur life was about infants and \nmothers. Her approach to social organization was longitudinal and develop-\n, \nmental, in contrast to DeVore's topical plot with dominant adult male central \nactors on a savannah stage set for hominid possibilities.

In spite of their frequent publications on the theme, some \nfemale former graduate students recall trying to avoid too much identifica-\ntion with the topic of females and infants - too much attention to females \npollutes the observer, labels the observer as peripheral. In any case, lay was \nrepeatedly requested to write papers on that subject for early collected \nvolumes on primates. Again, whatever her sense of the overall biology of \nlangurs, she was publicly associated with a story not named as the compar-\native centre for hominid innovation. Baboons were the privileged model \nsystem; and that meant, in the hands of DeVore, male activity. Although \nDeVore knew infants were centres of attraction, and all observers recorded \ninfant socialization in describing the genesis of group structure, the \nexplanation of a group could not rest on the activity of mothers and infants. \nlay explicitly saw the infant as a key centre of attraction in langur troop \nstructure; but that subplot was not a major component of her story \nconclttsiotlS. She described the passage of infants among females, relative \nmale lack of interest in infants, sex differences in infant development, the \nlack of well-defined dominance hierarchies among adult females, temporary \nalliances of adult females in conflict with other females (no female-female \norganizations were seen as stable or primary by Westerners until well after \n1960, and matrilines continued to be about ranks of sons for even longer), \nlow incidences of aggression in the troops, and generally looser troop \norganization than DeVore's baboons had. She argued that the mother-infant \nrelationship was the most intense of a langur's life, maintaining as well that \nall dominance structures were exceedingly complex and subtle and not very \nimportant in daily existence. In short, she literally, physically saw what \nalmost could not figure in her major conclusions because another story \nordered what counted as ultimate explanation. Washburn's physical anthro-\npology of man-the-hunter required comparative primate social behaviour \nstudies, but the not-so-silent centre of comparison lived on the Mrican \nsavannah and yawned a dominant threat at other story structures and \nconclusions. All comparisons are not equal when the scientific goal is to \nknow 'man's' place in nature. \nWhen possible, lay conducted her observations physically from within the \ntroop; she acted like a troop subordinate, averting her eyes from direct \nglances to avoid any provocation. Although most langur troops lay watched \ncould not be observed from within because, for example, they were high in \ntrees overhead, lay's only explicit methodological comment in her early \npapers about her own physical relation as an observer named herself \nexplicitly within the troop, and neither dominant nor intervening to provoke \nthe animals' dominance among themselves.

DeVore also \nexperimentally provoked the male-male dominance interactions that had to \nbe seen to signifY central meanings, called observations. lay, on the other \nhand, spent much less space describing male activities than those offemales \nand infants and had a hard time specifYing exactly what males did that \nmattered in daily troop life. However, she explicitly concluded, 'Adult males \nmaintain internal troop stability by establishing and asserting a stable male \ndominance hierarchy that structures the relationships of adult males within \nthe troop' (Dolhinow, 1972, p. 230). Males were leaders who co-ordinated \ntroop unity and stability, despite the observation structure of her papers. It \nwas the generation of Washburn daughters after lay who turned the constant \nobservations of matrifocal groups into an explanation of troop structure and \ninto privileged models for hominid evolution. 13 \nAlthough females and infants were very visible to Jay, she did not see \nsomething which other observers elsewhere began to report in dramatic \nterms: males killing infants after they moved into a troop, ousting the \nprevious resident male or males. For example, Yukimaru Sugiyama from the \nLaboratory of Physical Anthropology at Kyoto University, and part of the \nteam from the Japan Monkey Center that studied langurs at Dharwar from \n1961 to 1963, told a story of animals for whom, 'Apart from the fact that one \nlarge adult male leads the troop, there is no other evident social differenti-\nation.' He observed what he called 'social change' in troops, including \n'reconstruction' through successful attack of a bisexual troop by an all-male \ngroup. Subsequently, all but one of the usurping males were ousted. In the \nnext two months the remaining male apparently bit a juvenile female and all \nfive troop infants, none of whom survived. But it seems Sugiyama did not see \nthe male killing the infants. The same observer also experimentally provoked \ntroop social change by removing the sole male (called 'the dominant male \noverlord who had protected and led the troop') in another bisexual group. \nUltimately a male entering this troop killed four infants; these events appear \nto have been witnessed directly. In these studies the important experimental \nmanipulations of troops, that is, of model systems for studying social \norganization, were alw'9's of high-status males, presumed points of organic \nvitality and 'social change,.'4 \nIt was not that Jay could not record such a drastic event; none occurred \nduring her study or in her region of India. But she did comment on others' \nobservations of infant deaths in noting the extraordinary variability of habitat \nand behaviour characteristic of langurs and the need for more study \ncorrelating ecology and social behaviour. It is here that the criteria for \ndeciding the significance of male troop takeover and infanticide began to be \nenunciated. For Jay, such 'rapid social change' occurred in the context of a \nhigh population density of langurs, which produced stress that in tum \n",

In any \ncase, these events occupied the periphery of a stage set to represent the \nsuccess of social groups as primate adaptations. That stage was necessary to \nman-the-hunter as harbinger of human, male-based co-operation expressed \nthrough healthy dominance relations. Jay noted the observations of infanti-\ncide, but her story did not alter because of them. \nLet us now turn to a major effort to wreck that stage in the confrontation \nof sociobiological explanation with the rules for meaning that had given birth \nto the Washburn line. Then we will return to the question of key event in \nexplanatory stories versus accidental occurrence or social pathology. For \nSarah Blaffer Hrdy the social group emphasis seemed to obscure, ironically, \nfemale equality - equality in reproductive strategies, that is. But reproductive \nstrategies lie close to the heart of contests for political meanings in the 1970S \nand 1980s, including full human female citizenship in the United States \nbased on reproductive autonomy, 'ownership of one's own body'. \nReproductive strategies concern the body's invesnnents. Remember that at \nleast since Thomas Hobbes and seventeenth-century debates in England \nabout sovereignty, citizenship, and suffrage, property in the self - the right \nand ability to dispose of one's investment, one's incorporation - was argued \nto ground legitimate political action, particularly the formation of civil society \nin contrast to a supposedly natural reproductive family. The sociobiological \nlogic of feminism we are about to glance at draws from the theoretical \nwellsprings of Western political democracy. Pollution of the waters does not \ndate from E. O. Wilson's sociobiological publications on human nature. \nBiology's logic of reproductive competition is merely one common, early \nform of argument in our inherited capitalist political economy and political \ntheory. Biology has intrinsically been a branch of political discourse, not a \ncompendium of objective truth. Further, simply noting such a connection \nbetween biological and politicaVeconomic discourse is not a good argument \nfor dismissing such biological argument as bad science or mere ideology. It \nshould not be surprising that the contest over langur infanticide touches raw \npolitical and scientific nerves. \nA LANGUR ODYSSEY: HEROES, SEX, AND \nINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT \nIn Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's version of langur life, infanticide and male troop \ntakeovers became the key to the meaning of langur social behaviour. And \nHrdy's (1977) work was heralded with meanings Jay/Dolhinow never \nclaimed: the dust jacket to her Harvard University Pressbook announces \n'17ze LanguTS of Abu (subtitle: Female and Male Strategies of Reproduction) is the \nfirst book to analyze behavior of wild primates from the standpoint of both \nsexes.

Hrdy, the former graduate student of \nIrven DeVore at Harvard, also worked closely with Robert Trivers and \nE.O. Wilson. These three men are fundamental sociobiological theorists. \nDeVore, in root opposition to Washburn, has reinterpreted the social \nanthropology of human hunter-gatherers in terms of the behavioural systems \nemerging from a genetic kinship calculus of interest. For Hrdy, the primate \nsocial group became one possible result of the strategies of individual \nreproducers to maximize their genetic fitness, to capitalize on their genetic \ninvesnnents. The social origin story of pure liberal, utilitarian political \neconomy ruled; individual competition produced all the forms of combina-\ntion of the efficient animal machine. Social life was a market where \ninvesnnents were made and tested in the only currency that counts: genetic \nincrease. \nInfanticidp in certain circumstances became a rational reproductive \nstrategy vi langur males, opposed to a rational extent by langur females, \nwhose reproductive interests were certainly not the same as the males'. \nIndeed, root sexual conflict from a sociobiological viewpoint is a necessary \nconsequence of sexual reproduction. Any genetic difference introduces \nsome degree of conflict, even if expressed in coalition. The pattern here is \nthe reverse of seeing dominance hierarchies as mechanisms of co-ordination \nfor the chief adaptational complex, the social group. Sociobiologists might \nstill view dominance hierarchies as patterns co-ordinating a social group, but \nthe basic logic is different. All biological structures are expressions of a \ngenetic calculus of interest, that is, the best possible (not perfect) resolutions \nof fundamental conflict when all the elements in a system need each other \nfor their own reproductive success. Note that the crucial level of explanation \nis not mechanism, function, or way oflife, but pared-down fitness maximiza-\ntion strategy. Explanation is game theory. The dust jacket of Hrdy's book \ncould call her use of this logic 'feminist' because she paid systematic \nattention to female activity in their reproductive interest and did not explain \nindividual behaviour in terms of roles for co-ordinating elements for group \nsurvival. Wbere JaylDolhinow speaks of adaptation, Hrdy speaks of selec-\ntion. It is only in a situation of direct controversy that all the differences in \nmeaning of these two apparently harmonious evolutionary terms emerge. \nAlthough Hrdy did not, probably, write her own dust jacket, it still frames \nher story for readers. She did, however, write her dedication and acknow-\nledgements, both marvellous icons, or stories in miniature, suggesting public \nmeanings that open a book replete with the language of heroic struggle and \nOdyssean voyages to preserve the products of genetic invesnnent in \ndangerous times.

Wilson, introduced me to a realm of theory that \ntransformed my view of the social world.' The mundane nature of scientific \nsocialization again shows clearly. After acknowledging langurs themselves, \nanimals named after gods and heroes in Hindu and Roman mythology \n(Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god, and Entellus, a boxing champion in the \nAe1leid), Hrdy concluded, 'Anyone heroic enough to read on to the end of \nthis book will learn why the identification of langurs with warriors was an \nappropriate taxonomic choice, and why the final salute must be to the \nprescience of the nineteenth-century British naturalists who first went out to \nstudy the Hanuman (1977, pp. v-x). A salute to the naturalist-imperialist \nventures of Britain at the height of its bourgeois triumph, ideologized as a \nfruit of unrestrained capitalism, could not be more appropriate for the logic \nof the story that followed. \nHrdy's book is a sustained polemic against what she sees as group \nselection arguments and structural-functional social system theory. Dolhi-\nnow and her students are Hrdy's principal antagonists in a 'heroic' struggle \nfor correct vision. The purpose, like the purpose of the stories in the \northodox Washburn lineage, is to illuminate the logic of the human way of \nlife by telling scientific stories, thereby producing public meanings. As Hrdy \nput it: \nNot surprisingly, when we first began to intensively study our closest \nnon-human relatives, the monkeys and apes, an idealization of our own \nsociety was extended to theirs: thus, according to the first primatological \nreports, monkeys, like humans, maintain complex social systems geared \ntowards ensuring the group's survival. It is this particular misconception \nabout ourselves, and about primates, that lends the history of langur \nstudies its significance. By revealing our misconceptions about other \nprimates, the langur saga may unmask misconceptions about ourselves. \n(1977. p. Il) \nIn the language of command, control, war, adultery, property and investment \nstrategies, and dramatic soap opera about power struggles, Hrdy tells a story \nthat is fundamentally a political history of troops dominated by male combat \nand female and male conflicting reproductive calculations. She argues for \nthe hypothesis that langur males have several possible reproductive strategies \ngiven the design constraints of a leaf-eating monkey body and their \necological niche possibilities.

'5 \nREPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AMONG OPPORTUNISTS: \nLANGURS AND PEOPLE AS ECOLOGICAL GENERALISTS \nBut before looking at the responses to the deviant daughter within the direct \n(legitimate?) Washburn lineage, let us look at the langur story of Jay/ \nDolltinow's near contemporary among graduate students at Berkeley, \nSuzanne Ripley. Ripley also enters in the contest for primate nature a \ncandidate for a model for human possibility within inherited constraint. Her \nmodel turns on the logic of mechanisms for population regulation and calls \non the language of women's contemporary struggles for reproductive rights, \nas well as the language of ecological stress and population catastrophes. \nSlress is a basic determinant of the story's plot. Stress has been a common \ntheme in the Washburn lineage. It is linked to stories of past adaptation and \nthe threat of present human obsolescence. And as Jay had published 'The \nFemale Primate' in a book entitled The POlellliai o[Warnell and Zihlman had \npublished 'Motherhood in Transition' in a conference organized around \nhuman psychiatric and therapeutic concerns for the family, resulting in the \nbook The First Child a1ld Family Fon7lati01l, Ripley published in a socially \ncharged context in a very scientifically respectable setting: an interdisciplin-\nary symposium on crowding, density dependence, and population regulation \nin 1978. The proceedings were published by Yale University Press. \nRipley's (1980) argument also contested for the logic of models for the \nhuman way oflife; hers, like those of many Washburn daughters, centred On \nfemale activity. The problem she set herself was to look at human infanticide \n",

Unlike Dolhinow, \nBogess, and Hrdy, she did not here contest for what counts as an \nobservation; she accepted the 'facts' of troop takeover and infanticide as \nestablished. She compared both human beings and langurs as foraging \ngeneralists with exceptionally wide ranges of habitat compared to the \nhabitats of their near relatives with similar design constraints set by their \nrespective basic biology (colobines and apes). How do langurs and humans \nsurvive as generalists within the parameters of their biology? Flexible social \nsystems and learned behavioural plasticity turning on reproductive practices \nare the answer. Sex is at the centre of the explanation, hardly a novel aspect \nof explanation in life science. Sex is the principle of increase (vitality) in \nbiological stories, and biology has been from its birth in the late eighteenth \ncentury a discourse about productive systems or, better, modes of produc-\ntion. Sex is also especially prone to stress and pathology. Finally, to connect \nreproduction and production has been the key theoretical desideratum of \nboth natural and political economy for 200 years. \nRipley's story contends that generalists exploit marginal habitats all the \ntime, avoiding specialization and its confining consequences. A cost of this \nlife strategy is periodic population crashes, when marginality turns into \ndisaster; a need then is for a reproductive-behavioural system that can \nre-establish populations quickly. That property entails the inevitability of \nperiodic population excesses when conditions are easy. So in tum some \nfeedback population regulation mechanism should be expected in successful \nspecies, and infanticide is a perfectly good candidate. Note the general \ncybernetic model of the animal machine; this aspect of models is typical of \npost-Second World War stories. Steam engines and telephone exchanges \nbelong to an earlier era of biology. \nThe best feedback device should operate close to the steps tying \nreproductive and subsistence subsystems of species life strategies together. \nSo for humans, female-controlled infanticide in gatherer-hunter groups \nwould be an excellent mechanism for maintaining population regulation, that \nis, a close fit of subsistence opportunities and numbers. Ripley assumes the \ndemotion of hunting and the requirement to consider female activity in \nhominid subsistence innovations. That she can so quietly assume this major \nchange in stories in physical anthropology in 1980 is the result of work by \nothers, many in the Washburn lineage, in the context of an 'external' \nwomen's movement. \nIn langurs, infanticide is male-controlled; but that is a minor point. \nLangurs also need some mechanism for ensuring outbreeding in the \nface of their rather closed troop structure. Male aggression and troop \ntakeover habits in crowded conditions ensure just that good. Humans have \n",

For all the story-tellers in \nthis paper, real explanation is evolutionary, a plot in which the past both \nconstrains and enables the future and contains its germ of change, even \nprogress. But for Ripley, infanticide is a mechanism, one possible, rather \ninteresting enabling strategy for obligate generalists. Male langur reproduct-\nive strategies are proximate causes; final causes ('ultimate biological value') \nare retention of polymorphism of genotypes in populatiolls for an ecological \ngeneralist within a social structure that otherwise produces inbreeding. \nHrdy's final causes are strategies of least units of reproduction: genes or \nindividuals. Ripley is not arguing for group selection, but for the genetic \nconditions of continued system persistence. \nIn her conclusions, Ripley focuses on questions of adaptation, pathology, \nstress, obsolescence, and the limits of models. Facing an analogous evolu-\ntionary dilemma, langurs and humans, though phylogenetically remote, are \nrelated in modelling a jOintly experienced opposition of fundamental \nconditions for continued existence. Human population dilemmas are not \nnew, from this point of view, but are an aspect of our basic evolutionary \nhistory for which people found a learned behavioural solution (female-\nregulated infanticide) in small-group societies. Modem humans, though, do \nintroduce a troubling novelty. They have uncoupled decisions about repro-\nduction and production. The ability to make decisions about future \necosystem-carrying capacity does not lie with reproducing units, and rapid \nfeedback regulation could hardly be expected. What is a simple achievement \nin small-scale societies is nearly impossible in modem conditions. The \nthreat of obsolescence in the face of such stresses suggests solutions: small is \nbeautiful, and women should make decisions about productive and repro-\nductive links in the human life system. Of course, biological value is not \nsocial value; but still Ripley concludes pregnantly: \nIt seems that the possibility of adaptive infanticide is an inevitable \naccompaniment of the status of an ecologically generalist species and is \nsimply a price our species had to pay in the process of becoming, and \nremaining, human. It is the interplay of carrying capacity ... and \ncombinations of evolutionary strategies (generalist or specialist ... ) that \ndetermines the biological value of infanticide in both human and non-\nhuman primate species problems.

It is \nall a question of becoming and remaining human, a stressful problem. \nWHO SAW WHAT: THE DESTABILIZATION OF FACTS \nOf course, Ripley and Hrdy may simply be wrong; at least that conclusion is \nargued in still another version of the langur story, that of Jane Bogess of the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley. Bogess argues that Hrdy and others who \nadvance the language of troop takeover and goal-directed infant-killing by \nmales fundamentally have not fulfilled the necessary conditions for convinc-\ning their peers they know what they claim. Bogess works to establish that \nHrdy and others extrapolated on the basis of the logic of their stories, and \nthat the best observational foundations lead to different stories, those closely \nrelated to Dolhinow's original ones, but with greater explicit emphasis on the \nworkings of natural selection. The core meaning of the Bogess tale is again \nsocial health and pathology (Bogess, '979, '980). \nBogess insists on naming putative troop 'takeover' as 'rapid social change' \n(also Jay's terminology), to avoid the teleology of the sociobiological \ninvestroent argument. She looks at males in troop structure in terms of the \nconcept of 'male social instability' because offrequent changes in male troop \nmembership. She does not remark on this intriguing transformation in \nlanguage about males and the determinants of troop organization. She says \neasily, without comment, what twenty years ago no one saw or said. Bogess \ncan even say such things without further comment in a paper totally about \nmale behaviour. Female behaviour in '980 is an implicit centre partly ruling \nthe story's plot. Almost the opposite was true for Jay in '960. What \nintervened was more than monkeys - and more than primatology. Bogess \nargues that changes in male troop membership usually occur in staggered \nintroductions and exclusions, not dramatic takeovers. Moreover, infant-\nkilling was in fact rarely directly observed; and even when it was, ascribed \npaternity important to the logic of Hrdy's sociobiological story is very \ndoubtful. A second look at the reports suggests to Bogess that attacks may \nhave been against the females of troops in stressed circumstances and, \nfurthermore, may have been in keeping with a particular aspect of langur \nbiology (low tolerance, especially by females, of strangers). Hrdy's takeovers \nand infanticide become, in the view of Bogess, 'sudden and complete \nreplacement in adult male membership and attendant infant mortality' \n(1979, p. 88). \nStress was likely to be a human-mediated condition resulting from recent \nhabitat disruption. Behaviour resulting from modem human impacts on \nhabitat could hardly be given centre stage in the evolutionary story of \nlangurs. Infant-killing would then be either the sign of social pathology \nresulting from the unnatural human element or an 'accident'. Bogess argues \n",

If \nthe behaviours in question, infant-killing and uncontrolled male social \ninstability, harm the reproductive success of both sexes, call them patholo-\ngical, maladaptive. \nIn certain populations, where there is social crowding and artificially high \ndensities and where adult males live outside bisexual troops, the species-\ntypical characteristic male social instability can operate against the \nreproductive success of all troop members, including the new male \nresidents. (Bogess, '979, p. 104) \nBogess values explanation at the level of mechanisms; like Dolhinow she is \ncommitted to structural-functionalism and neo-Darwinian evolutionary \ntheory. She is interested in the social system as a behavioural adaptation, and \nshe focuses on environmental variables and range of flexibility in the social \nsystem. \nBut Bogess does enter the argument about genetic fitness maximization \nstrategies; such an argument is required in contemporary evolutionary \ndiscourse. She is within the received logics of this argument in focusing on \ninter-male dominance competition as the primary male strategy for maximiz-\ning male reproductive success, but not for troop organization itself. She \ncarefully documents exactly what she means by male dominance competi-\ntion. Rates and forms of competition are here contested more than the logic \nof explanation. But perhaps the most fundamental challenge of Bogess's \npaper to other langur students is from her standards of field work and \ndissection of what can count as data.

But no class of these \nstories can be seen as innocent, free of detennination by historically specific \nsocial relations and daily practice in producing and reproducing daily life. \nSurely scientific stories are not innocent in that sense. It is equally true that \nno class of tales can be free of rules for narrating a proper story within a \nparticular genre, in this case the discourse of life science. DemystifYing those \nrules seems important to me. Nature is constructed, constituted historically, \nnot discovered naked in a fossil bed or a tropical forest. Nature is contested, \nand women have enthusiastically entered the fray. Some women have the \nsocial authority to author scientific stories. \nThat fact is fairly new. Before the Second World War, indeed before the \nbirth of the daughters of the Washburn patriline, women did not directly \ncontest for primate nature; men did. That point mattered, as even a sceptical \nglance at the work of the leaders in primatology (for example, Robert Yerkes \nor Solly Zuckerman) will show. Many primatologists, including women, \nclaim gender does not materially determine the contents of natural science; \nif it does, the result is called poor science. I think the evidence supports a \ndifferent interpretation. At the least, gender is an unavoidable condition of \nobservation. So also are class, race, and nation. \nIt is also new to look at a group of women constituting the major \nauthoritative contestants in a publicly important debate. There are several \nmen who study langurs, but with a little qualification, exclusive focus on \nEuro-American women does not leave out the generative centres of debate \nabout the species. I do not think these white women are the major figures in \nlangur sagas merely because langurs appeal to their nature somehow. White \nwomen exist in primatology in substantial numbers; they occupy nearly every \nposition possible in various controversies, and they have collectively changed \nthe rules for explicit and implicit logics of stories. It is no longer acceptably \nscientific to argue about animal models for a human way of life without \nconsidering female and infant activity as well as male. That result seems \ncomplexly the product both of a historical world-wide women's movement \nand of phenomena made visible by field and laboratory practice in primatol-\nogy by culturally specific men and women. It has not just been the women \nwhose scientific practice has responded to recent history. What would the \nstories be in a genuinely multi-racial field of practice? \nWomen scientists do not produce nicer, much less more natural, stories \nthan men do; they produce their stories in the rule-guided public social \npractice of science. They help make the rules; it is a mundane affair \nrequiring the trained energy of women's concrete lives.

I believe it is even less responsible \nin present historical conditions to pursue anti-scientific tales about nature \nthat idealize women, nurturing, or some other entity argued to be free of \nmale war-tainted pollution. Scientific stories have too much power as public \nmyth to effect meanings in our lives. Besides, scientific stories are interest-\ning. \nMy moral is that feminists across the cultural field of differences should \ncontest to tell stories and to set the historical conditions for imagining plots. \nIt should be clear that the nature of feminism is no less at issue than langur \nsocial habits. There seems a grain of truth in the dust jacket statement of \nHarvard University Press that simply putting females at an explanatory \ncentre is in some sense fentinist. But not just any story will do. Hrdy's sense \nof our illusions about our social life is not ntine. The differences matter. \nExplanations of hum an female sexual physiology provide good examples of \nstories that have centred on females, but the stories remain profoundly male \nsupremacist. Loss of oestrus in the hominid line has been part of the \nexplanation of primate society for a long time. Or rather, loss of oestrus by \nfemales needed explaining, as differences generally do in our narratives. An \nimportant father in primatology, Solly Zuckerman, followed the example \nof his fathers from Aristotle through the nineteenth-century naturalists \neulogized by Hrdy: the female sexual pattern wasfor male control of women. \nZuckerman gave a functional biological explanation. So for him, and \neverybody else in these narrative communities until very recently, female \nhuman non-oestrus menstrual cycles enabled males to count on female \nsexual fidelity, that is, on women unpossessed by cycles of sexual insatiability \nwhen the owner-male was out making culture by co-operating with other \nmales. In 1967 a son in the Washburn patriline, Donald Lindberg, \nemphasized the fact, known since Darwin, of female sexual selection; that is, \nanimal females generally determine with whom they will mate. Lindberg put \nthis principle in the context of debates about primate physiology and \nevolution. A few years later a daughter, Adrienne Zihlman, took Lindberg's \nelement and wove it into a story about the physiological conditions for \nevolution of the human way of life - a way of life that depended on greater \nfemale control of her own sexuality, in the context of gathering-and-sharing \nsubsistence innovations and altered reproductive practices that had the \neffect of selecting males who knew how to co-operate with stable female-\ncentred social groups basic to human evolution. 16 I like that new story; I also \nsuggest that it changed the rules of what can count in scientific debate about \n~estrus.

Such teaching inherits, constructs, and transmits par-\nticular reading and writing practices that are politically complex. \nThese material practices are part of the apparatus for producing \nwhat will count as 'experience' on personal and collective levels in women's \nmovement. 2 It is crucial to be accountable for the politics of experience in \nthe i11stitution of women's studies. Such accountability is not easy, nor is it \nobvious what forms it might take, nor how struggles over different articula-\ntions of experience and different positionings for making these articulations \nshould be addressed. Nor can experience be allowed simply to appear as \nendlessly plural and unchallengeable, as if self-evident, readily available \nwhen we look 'inside' ourselves, and only one's own, or only one's group's. \nE~:perience is a crucial product and meatlS of women's movement; we must \nstruggle over the terms of its articulation. Women do not find 'experience' \nready to hand any more than they/we find 'nature' or the 'body' preformed, \nalways innocent and waiting outside the violations of language and culture. \nJust as nature is one of culture's most startling and non-innocent products, \nso is experience one of the least innocent, least self-evident aspects of \nhistorical, embodied movement. \nThrough the politically explosive terrain of linked experience feminists \nmake connection and enter into movement. Complexity, heterogeneity, \nspecific positioning, and power-charged difference are not the same thing as \nliberal pluralism. Experience is a semiosis, an embodying of meanings (de \nLauretis, 1984, pp. 158-86). The politics of difference that feminists need to \narticulate must be rooted in a politics of experience that searches for \nspecificity, heterogeneity, and connection through stmggle, not through \npsychologistic, liberal appeals to each her own endless difference. Feminism \nis collective; and difference is political, that is, about power, accountability, \nand hope. Experience, like difference, is about contradictory and necessary \nconnection. \nI am writing here as a Euro-American, professional, tenured, feminist, \n",

It is not the \nsame thing to teach women's studies at the University of California at Santa \nCruz in 1989 as it was at the University of Hawaii in 1970. The University of \nHawaii was in important respects obviously a colonial institution, located at \nthe periphery of educational privilege in the US. Many of the students in my \nwomen's studies classes were women and men of colour, majoring in hotel \nmanagement and other tourist industry subjects. Feminism as a word was \nhardly used, and the Women's Liberation Movement seemed to me and \nmany of those I knew in women's movement to be very new, very radical, and \nunproblematically singular. We were wrong about many of those judge-\nments. UCSC is a relatively left-wing, feminist, and - what ought to be an \noxymoron - largely white campus within the most privileged sector of the \nstate higher educational system in a period of acute racism, class antagonism, \nlanguage chauvinism, sexism, homophobia, and political reaction of many \nkinds in the state of California and in the nation. It is also a period of \ntremendous transformation in the racial and ethnic composition and power \nrelations in the state and the nation. And it is a period of exhilarating \nmulti-cultural production; the last quarter of the twentieth century is a time \nof a many-coloured cultural and political, local, and global renaissance. The \ndays of white hegemony - a power consolidation perhaps more dangerous \nnow than ever - seem visibly numbered. These matters profoundly affect the \nconstructions of 'women's experience' in the classroom. \nIn these circumstances, I am regularly responsible for teaching 'Methodo-\nlogical Issues in the Study of Women', a required course in a women's \nstudies major. In the present potent political moment, the intense intersec-\ntions and co-constructions of feminist theory, the critique of colonial \ndiscourse, and anti-racist theory have fundamentally restructured indi-\nvidually and collectively the always contested meanings of what counts as \n'women's experience', What may count as 'women's experience' has shifted \nin the discursive practices of feminism over its history. Showing how \nteaching arrangements are themselves theoretical practice, those of us \nteaching women's studies need to come to terms with these issues in our \npedagogical approaches for beginning students. Women's studies pedagogy \nis a theoretical practice through which 'women's experience' is constructed \nand mobilized as an object of knowledge and action. In this chapter I want to \ninspect a small part of the apparatus for the discursive production of \nwomen's experience in the women's studies classrooms which I inhabit and \nfor which I am accountable to and with others in the circuits of women's \nmovement. \nA typical class might begin with the serious logical joke that, especially for \nthe complex category and even more complex people called 'women', A and \n",

This correct exaggeration insists \nthat even the simplest matters in feminist analysis require contradictory \nmoments and a wariness of their resolution, dialectically or otherwise. \n'Situated knowledges' is a shorthand term for this insistence. Situated \nknowledges build in accountability.3 Being situated in an ungraspable \nmiddle space characterizes actors whose worlds might be described by \nbranching bushes like the map or bush of consciousness I have drawn in \nFigure 3.4 Situated knowledges are particularly powerful tools to produce \nmaps of consciousness for people who have been inscribed within the \nmarked categories of race and sex that have been so exuberantly produced in \nthe histories of masculinist, racist, and colonialist dominations. Situated \nknowledges are always marked knowledges; they are re-markings, reorientat-\nings, of the great maps that globalized the heterogeneous body of the world \nin the history of masculinist capitalism and colonialism. \nThe 'bush of women's consciousness' or the 'bush of women's experience' \nis a simple diagramatic model for indicating how feminist theory and the \ncritical study of colonial discourse intersect with each other in terms of two \ncrucial binary pairs - that is, local/global and penOllal/political. While the \ntones of personaVpolitical sound most strongly in feminist discourse, and \n10caVglobai in the critical theory of colonial discourse, both binaries are tools \nessential to the construction of each. Also, of course, each term of the binary \nconstructs its opposite. I have put the pair 'locaVglobal' at the top of the \ndiagram. To begin, drawing from a particular descriptive practice (which can \nnever simply be innocently available; descriptions are produced), place an \naccount of 'women's experience' or 'women's consciousness' at the top. The \nsimple 'dichotomizing machine' immediately bifurcates the experience into \ntwo aspect'), 'locaVglobal' or 'personal/political'. Wherever one begins, each \nterm in tum bifurcates: the 'local' into 'personal/\\political' and the 'global' \ninto 'personal/\\political'. Similarly, continuing indefinitely, every instance of \nthe analytical pair 'personaVpolitical' splits on each side into 'locaVglobal'. \nThis noisy little analytical engine works almost like the dichotomous \nsystems of European Renaissance rhetoricians, such as Peter Ramus, to \npersuade, teach, and taxonomize simultaneously by means of an analytical \ntechnology that palpably makes its objects simultaneously with bisecting \nthem. Referring to the European Renaissance should also alert us to the \nparticular Western history of binary analysis in general and of the pairs \nadopted here in particular. Other binary pairs that might well appear in my \nbush are 'liberatory/oppositional' or 'resistance/revolution', pairs deeply \nembedded in particular Western histories (Ong, 1988). Noting this tradition \ndoes not invalidate its use; it locates its use and insists on its partiality and \naccountability. The difference is important. Binaries, rather suspect for the \nfeminists I know, can tum out to be nice little tools from time to time. \n",

What may count \nas 'women's experience' is structured within multiple and often inharmo-\nnious agendas. 'Experience', like 'consciousness\" is an intentional construc-\ntion, an artefact of the first importance. Experience may also be re-\nconstructed, re-membered, re-articulated. One powerful means to do so is \nthe reading and re-reading of fiction in such a way as to create the effect of \nhaving access to another's life and consciousness, whether that other is an \nindividual or a collective person with the lifetime called history. These \nreadings exist in a field of resonating readings, in which each version adds \ntones and shapes to the others, in both cacophonous and consonant waves. \nClaims about 'women's experience' are particularly liable to derive from \nand contribute to what Wendy Rose, in a poem about appropriations of \nNative American experience, aptly called 'the tourism of the soul'. Women's \nstudies must negotiate the very fine line between appropriation of another's \n(never innocent) experience and the delicate construction of the just-barely-\npossible affinities, the just-barely-possible connections that might actually \nmake a difference in local and global histories. Feminist discourse and \nanti-colonial discourse are engaged in this very subtle and delicate effort to \nbuild connections and affinities, and not to produce one's own or another's \nexperience as a resource for a closed narrative. These are difficult issues, \nand 'we' fail frequently. It is easy to find feminist, anti-racist, and \nanti-colonial discourses reproducing others and selves as resources for \nclosed narratives, not knowing how to build affinities, knowing instead how \nto build oppositions. But 'our' writing is also full of hope that we will learn \nhow to structure affinities instead of identities. \nThe construction of 'women's experience' through the reading of fiction \nin women's studies classrooms and women's studies publishing is the \npractice I wish to examine in this chapter. My focus is on particularly \nnon-innocent objects at this moment in 'our' history in Santa Cruz and in \nthe world: 'African' women's fiction; contending readings of this fiction; and \nthe field of constructions of women's consciousness and experience in the \n'African diaspora' as an allegorical figure for many political constituencies, \nlocal and global.

The contradictions and the \nstruggles are all the sharper for women's writing and reading of these potent \nfictions. As Lata Mani (1987) has made clear from her study of eighteenth-\ncentury colonial discourse on suttee in India, constructions of women's \nexperience can be fundamental to the invention of 'tradition', 'culture', and \n'religion', Women are a privileged 'site of discourse', On this terrain, \ntaxation, labour migration policies, or family law have been and still can be \nlegitimated or resisted. Women's 'self-constructions' of experience, history, \nand consciousness will be no less the ground of material practice - including \n'our' own. (Watch how 'experience', 'history', and 'consciousness' are all \ncomplex European-derived terms with particular resonances in many US \ncultures, including Euro-American ethnophilosophies important in aca-\ndemic and activist contexts.)5 \nReading fiction has had a potent place in women's studies practice. \nFiction may be appropriated in many ways. What will count as fiction is itself \na contentious matter, resolved partly by market considerations, linguistic and \nsemiotic practices, writing technologies, and circuits of readers. It is possible \nto foreground or to obscure the publishing practices that make some fiction \nparticularly visible or particularly unavailable in women's studies markets. \nThe material object, the book itself, may be made to seem invisible and \ntransparent or to provide a physical clue to circulations of meanings and \npower. These points have been made forcefully in Katie King's (1988) \nreading of the 'genre' of biomythography in Audre Lorde's (1982) Zallli. \nReadings may function as technologies for constructing what may count as \nwomen's experience and for mapping connections and separations among \nwomen and the social movements which they build and in which they \nparticipate in local/global worlds. Fiction may be mobilized to provoke \nidentifications as well as oppositions, divergences, and convergences in maps \nof consciousness.

The most straightforward readings of any text are also situated \narguments about fields of meanings and fields of power. Any reading is also a \nguide to possible maps of consciousness, coalition, and action.

Contesting critically for readings is a fundamental \nwomen's studies practice that simultaneously insists on the constructed \nquality of politics and meanings and holds the readers responsible for their \nconstructions as ways of making and unmaking the potent and polysemic \ncategory, 'women', In this category feminist, colonizing, anti-colonial, and \nwomanist discourses converge and diverge powerfully. Partially allied and \npartially contending, differently situated women's readings of the fiction \npublished by a 'Third World woman of colour', who personally and textually \nalso inhabits the 'First World', foreground the issues I am trying to sketch. \nThe readers themselves are tied and separated by multiple histories and \nlocations, including race, sexuality, nationality, access to reading publics, and \naccess to the fictions themselves. How are these readings maps of possible \nmodes of affinity and difference on the post-colonial terrain of women's \nliberatory discourses? How do the figures of the unity of women in the \nAfrican diaspora enter into nationalist, feminist, womanist, postmodernist, \nblack, multi-cultural, white, First World, Third World, and other political \nlocations? \nSo, risking falling into the 'tourism of the soul' that Wendy Rose warned \nagainst, I will outline three different readings of a popular author, most of \nwhose readers probably have no interest in women's studies, but whose \nfiction appears in women's studies courses and is also an object of contention \nin womanistlfeminist literary criticism and politics. Before engaging with \nthese t'1ree readings, consider a short construction of the text of the author's \nlife, a text that will become part of my stakes in reading her fiction. The \nauthor is Buchi Emecheta, born in Nigeria in 1944 of Ibuza background. \nEmecheta married in 1962 and went to London with her husband, who had \na student fellowship. In England, the couple had five children in difficult \ncircumstances, and the marriage ended painfully. Emecheta found herself a \nsingle mother in London, black, immigrant, on welfare, Hving in council \nhOllsing, and going to college for a degree in library science and then for a \nPhD in sociology6 \nEmecheta also became a writer. Her becoming a writer was constituted \nfrom those webs of 'experience' implicit in the biographical text in the last \nparagraph, She was a mother, an immigrant, an independent woman, an \nAfrican, an lbo, an activist, a 'been to', a writer. It is said that her husband \ndestroyed her first manuscript because he could not bear the idea that his \nwife was thinking and acting for herself (Schipper, 1985, p. 44). She \npublished a series of novels that are simultaneously pedagogical, popular, \nhistorical, political, autobiographical, romantic - and contentious. \nLet us study the dust jackets and reference library texts on Emecheta's life \na little further.

In the UK, Emecheta's \nwork is published by Allen & Unwin and by Allison & Busby, in the US by \nBraziller, and in Nigeria by Ogwugwu Afor. Until recently, it was easier to \npurchase Emecheta's fiction in England or the US than in Nigeria. \nEmecheta's writing is read as mass-market paperbacks on trains and buses in \nBritain more than it is read in classrooms. Her work is now published \nsimultaneously in Africa and the West, and it is part of debates among \nAfrican anglophone readers. In part because of its treatment of African \nwomen's issues by an expatriate identified with feminism, Emecheta's \nwriting is controversial, perhaps especially in Nigeria and especially among \npolitical academics everywhere it is read. \nThe Dutch critic, Mineke Schipper (1985, p. 46), claimed that 'Emecheta's \nnovels are extremely popular in Nigeria and elsewhere, but they have some-\ntimes been coolly received or even ignored by African critics.' Emecheta's \nrelations to feminism, and the relations of her readers to feminism, are very \nmuch at the heart of this matter. Adopting a perspective that bell hooks in \nthe United States named intrinsic to feminist movement, in an interview in \n1979 Emecheta's account of her writing explicitly refused to restrict her \nattention to women: \nThe main themes of my novels are African society and family: the \nhistorical, social, and political life in Africa as seen by a woman through \nevents. I always try to show that the African male is oppressed and he too \noppresses the African women ... I have not committed myself to the \ncause of African women only, I write about Africa as a whole.

The woman subse-\nquently conceived all too many children, but only after she lost access to her \nown trading networks and so lost her own income. The mother moved from \nvillage to city; and her children emigrated to Canada, the United States, and \nAustralia. Although she had many sons, she died childless in an extraordin-\narily painful story of the confrontation of urban and village realities for \nwomen in early twentieth-century Nigeria. \nBut, as for Achebe, for Emecheta also there is no moment of innocence in \nAfrica's history before the fall into the conflict between 'tradition' and \n'modernity'.

In The Bride Price (1976) and The Slave Girl \n(1977), Emecheta explored fundamental issues around marriage, control of \none's life from different women's points of view, and the contradictory \npositions, especially for her Ibuza women characters, in every location on the \nAfrican cultural map, whether marked foreign or indigenous. Life in Europe \nwas no less the locus of struggle for Emecheta's characters. Second Class \nCitizell (1974) explored the breakup of the protagonist's marriage in \nLondon. In the Ditch (1972, 1979) followed the main character as a single \nmother into residence in British council housing and her solidarity with \nwhite and coloured, working-class, British women's and feminist organiza-\ntions challenging the terms of the welfare state. The Double Yoke (1983a) \nreturned to Nigeria in the late twentieth century to take up again Emecheta's \ninterrogation of the terms of women's struggles in the local and global webs \nof the African diaspora, viewed from a fictional reconstruction of the paths of \ntravel from and to a minority region in Nigeria.7 \nIn my course called 'Methodological Issues in the Study of Women', the \nstudents read politically engaged essays by two literary theorists who placed \nEmecheta in their paradigms of women's fiction and women's unity in the \nAfrican diaspora. One was by Barbara Christian, a professor of Afro-\nAmerican Studies at the University of California at Berkeley and a pioneer of \nblack feminist literary criticism, and the other was by Chikwenye Okonjo \nOgunyemi, a professor teaching Afro-American and African literature in the \nEnglish Department at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. With women \nfrom Ibadan and Ife, Ogunyemi participated in 1988 in a group developing \nwomen's studies in Nigeria (Tola Olu Pearce, personal communcation). She \nhas published on Emecheta's fiction elsewhere (Ogunyemi, 1983); but in the \nteA1 we read in class, it was Ogunyemi's explicit marginalization of Emecheta \nthat organized our reading of her essay in its particular publishing context \nand in other political aspects. Barbara Christian published Black Feminist \nCriticism (1985) in the Athena series of Pergamon Press, a major feminist \nscries in British and US women's studies publishing. The third reading was \nmy own, developed from the perspectives of a Euro-American women's \nstudies teacher in a largely white state university in the United States and \nfirst delivered in a conference co-constructing the critical study of colonial \ndiscourse and feminist theory. I wanted my women's studies undergraduate \nstudents to read, mis-read, re-read, and so reflect on the field of possible \nreadings of a particular contested author, including the discursive construc-\ntions of her life on the literal surfaces of the published novels themselves. \nThese readings were directed to fictions in which we all had considerable \nstakes - the publishers', Emecheta's, Ogunyemi's, Christian's, mine, each of \nthe students', and those of anonymous readers of thousands of paperbacks in \nseveral nations.

The goal was to \nmake these critically reflexive readings open up the complexities of location \nand affinities in partially allied, partially oppositional drawings of maps of \nwomen's consciousness in the local/global, personal/political webs of \nsituated knowledges. \nFirst, let us examine how Ogunyemi (1985, pp. 66-7) read - or declined \nto read - Emecheta in an essay published for a largely non-African audience \nin SigllS: }01l17lal of Women in ClIltllre and Society, a major scholarly organ of \nfeminist theory in the US. Out of seventeen international correspondents for \nSigns, one was from Africa in 1987 - Achola Pala of Kenya. Many Signs \nessays are assigned in women's studies courses, where most, but by no \nmeans all, of the students would be Euro-Americans. Ogunyemi's essay was \nan argument to distance herself from the label 'feminist' and to associate \nherself with the marker 'womanist'. She argued that she had independently \ndeveloped that term and then found Alice Walker's working of it. Ogunyemi \nproduced an archaeology or mapping of African and Afro-American \nanglophone women's literature since the end of colonization, roughly from \nthe 1960s. The map led to a place of political hope, called womanism. \nOgunyemi used the word to designate a woman committed to the survival \nand the wholeness of the 'entire people', men and women, Africa and \nthe people of its diaspora. She located her discourse on Emecheta in \nthe diaspora's joining of Afro-Caribbean, Afro-American, and African \nanglophone literatures. Ogunyemi argued that a womanist represents a \nparticular moment of maturity that affirms the unity of the whole people \nthrough a multi-layered exploration of the experiences of women as 'mothers \nof the people'. The mother binding up the wounds of a scattered people was \nan important image, potent for womanist movement away from both black \nmale chauvinism and feminist negativism, iconoclasm, and immaturity. \nBut Ogunyemi's principal image was somewhat oblique to that of the \nmother; it was a married woman. Ogunyemi read the fiction since the 1960s \nin order to construct the relationships of women in the diaspora as 'amicable \nco-wives with an invisible husband' (1985, p. 74)· In her archaeology of \nanglophone African and African-American literature that finds the traces of \nwomanism in black foremothers-as-writers, Ogunyemi rejected Emecheta. \nHer fiction did not affirm marriage as the image of full maturity that could \nrepresent the unity of black people internationally. Quite the opposite, \nEmecheta's explorations frequently involved an account of the failure of \nmarriage. In particular, far from recuperating polygamy as an image for \nliberatory women's movement, Emecheta regarded the practice as a 'de-\ncaying institution' that would disappear 'as women became more and more \n",

Emeche-\nta's fiction has a sharp edge on marriage throughout, even where it is most \naffirmed, as in Tlte DOllble Yoke. Seeing the novelist's characters as merely \nrebellious, Ogunyemi treated Emecheta's fictional and personal relation to \nmarriage harshly, even scornfully, stating that she started to write 'after a \nmarital fiasco', that her writing feminizes black men, and that she finally kills \noff her heroines in childbirth, enslavement in marriage, insanity, or aban-\ndonment by their children. Ogunyemi went so far as to claim, 'Emechet.'s \ndestruction of her heroines is a feminist trait that can be partly attributed to \nnarcissism on the part of the writer' (1985, p. 67). \nEmecheta in political action allied herself with Irish and British feminists \nand developed an international discourse quite different from Ogunyemi's \naccount of womaniSffi. In addition to criticizing Emecheta's discourse on and \nhistory in relation to marriage, Ogunyemi highlighted Emecheta's exile \nstatus. Having lived abroad for twenty years, Emecheta returned to Nigeria \nto teach in 1980-81 as a senior research fellow at the University of Calabar. \nOn this specific publishing occasion, Ogunyemi problematized Emecheta's \n'authenticity' as a returned emigrant writer. In Ogunyemi's archaeology of \nAfrican anglophone literature, socialism, feminism, and lesbianism all stood \nexplicitly for an immature moment, perhaps recuperable later, but for the \nmoment not incorporable within the voices of the 'co-wives', who figured a \nnormative kind of black women's unity. Womanism meant that the demands \nof 'culture' take precedence over those of 'sexual politics'. Because of that \nrelationship, for the womanist writer who still does not forget the inequities \nof patriarchy, 'the matrilineal and polygynous societies in Africa are dynamic \nsources for the womanist novel' (1985, p. 76). Ogunyemi proposed a logic of \ninclusion and exclusion in an emerging literary canon as part of a politics \nabout nationalism, gender, and internationalism, argued through the central \nimages of polygynous African marriage. \nBarbara Christian had very different stakes in reading Emecheta. In Black \nFeminist Criticism Christian read The }O)'S of Motherhood (1979) in close \nrelation with Alice Walker's Meridia\" (1976), in order specifically to reclaim \na matrilineal tradition around the images of a particular feminism that \nChristian's text foregrounds. Christian located this discourse on matrilineal \nconnection and mothering in these two important novels of the 1 970S in \norder to discuss the simultaneous exaltation and disruption! destruction of \nmothering for black women in African traditions, in Afro-American slavery, \nand in post-slavery and post-civil rights movement contexts in the US· She \nuncovered the contradictions and complexities of mothering, reflecting on \nthe many ways in which it is both enjoyed, celebrated, enforced, and turned \ninto a double bind for women in all of those historical locations.

Christian read Men'diall and 17\" Joys of Motherhood in delicate \necho with each other in order to foreground a particular kind of feminism \nthat also carried with it an agenda of affirming lesbianism within black \nfeminism and within the model of the inheritance from Africa of the tie \nbetween mother and daughter, caring for each other in the impossible \nconditions of a world that constantly disrupts the caring. Barbara Christian \nwas committed to forbidding the marginalization of lesbianism in feminist \ndiscourse by women of colour, and she subtly enlisted Emecheta as one of \nher texts, for precisely the same reasons that Ogunyemi excluded Emecheta \nfrom her genealogy of womanism in the African diaspora. But like Oguny-\nemi, Christian proposed a narrative of maturation in the history of the \nwriting of her literary foremothers. The trajectory of maturation for each \ntheorist provided a specific model of the growth of selfhood and community \nfor the women of the diaspora. Ogunyemi schematized the history of West \nAfrican women writers' consciousness since national independence move-\nments in tenns of an initial 'flirtation' with feminism and socialism, \nculminating in a mature womanism organized around the trope of the \ncommunity of women as mothers, healers, and writers centred in the image \nof 'co-wives with an absent husband'. That last image could not avoid being \na stark reminder of the labour migration realities for many rural women in \ncolonial and post-colonial Africa, even as it invoked the positive self-\nsufficiency of married women, in contrast to the Western stereotyped figure \nof the (hetero)sexualized white bourgeois couple with its dependent and \nisolated wife and her consequent negative 'feminise politics of protest. \nChristian's narrative schematized the history of Afro-American women \nwriters' consciousness in terms of a chronology with suggestive similarities to \nand differences from Ogunyemi's. Christian argued that, before about 1950, \nAmerican black women wrote for audiences that largely excluded them-\nselves. Christian characterized the fiction as other-directed, rather than \ninward searching, in response to the dominating white society's racist \ndefinitions of black women. Zora Neale Hurston was the exception to the \npattern. Christian traced a process of initial self-definition in the 1950S and \nthe emergence of attention to the ordinary dark-skinned black women. \nRoughly, the 1960s was a decade of fmding unity in shared blackness, the \n'970S a period of exposure of sexism in the black community, and the 19805 \na time of emergence of a diverse culture of black women engaged in finding \nselfhood and forming connections among women that promised to transcend \n",

My reading valorized her heterogeneous \nstatuses as exile, Nigerian, lbo, Irish-British feminist, black woman, writer \ncanonized in the African Writers Series, popular writer published in cheap \npaperback books and children's literature, librarian, mother on welfare, \nsociologist, single woman, reinventor of African tradition, deconstructor of \nAfrican tradition, member of the Advisory Council to the British Home \nSecretary on race and equality, subject of contention among committed \nmulti-racial womanist and feminist theorists, and international figure. As for \nOgunyemi and Christian, there was a utopian moment nestled in my \nreading, one that hoped for a space for political accountability and for \ncherishing ambiguities, multiplicities, and affinities without freezing identit-\nies. These risk being the pleasures of the eternal tourist of experience in \ndevastated postmodern terrains. But I wanted to stay with affinities that \nrefused to resolve into identities or searches for a true self. My reading \nnaturalized precisely the moments of ambiguity, the exile status and the \ndilemma of a 'been-to' for whom the time of origins and returns is \ninaccessible. Contradiction held in tension with the crafting of accountability \nwas my image of the hoped-for unity of women across the holocaust of \nimperialism, racism, and masculinist supremacy. This was a feminist image \nthat figured not mothers and daughters, co-wives, sisters, or lesbian lovers, \nbut adopted families and imperfect intentional communities, based not so \nmuch on 'choice' as on hope and memory of the always already fallen apart \nstructure of the world. I valued in Emecheta the similarities to the \npost-holocaust reinvented 'families' in the fiction of Afro-American SF \nwriter, Octavia Butler, as tropes to guide 'us' through the ravages of gender, \nclass, imperialism, racism, and nuclear exterminist global culture. \nMy reading of Emecheta drew on The Double Yoke (1983a), in which the \nincoherent demands on and possibilities for women in the collision of \nItradition' and 'modernity' are interrogated.

In The Doub/, \nYoke, a 'been-to', Miss Bulewao, taught creative writing to a group of mainly \nyoung men at the University of Calabar. Framed by Miss Bulewao's \nassignment to the students and her response to the moral dilemmas posed in \none man's story, the core of the novel was the essay submitted by Ete \nKamba, who had fallen in love with a young woman, Nko, who lived a mile \nfrom his village. Nko, a young Efik woman, came from a different ethnic \ngroup from Ete Kamba, an Ikikio. Hoping to marry, both were at the \nuniversity on scholarships and both had complicated obligations to parents as \nwell as ambitions of their own. But gender made their situations far from \nsymmetrical. In a narrative that cannot but refer the reader to Aihwa Ong's \n(lg87) account of young Malay factory workers in Japanese multinationals in \nMalaysia, Emecheta sketched the University of Calabar as a microcosm of \nthe contending forces within post-independence Nigeria, including the New \nChristian Movement, Islamic identities, demands of ethnic groups, eco-\nnomic constraints from both family and national locations in the global \neconomy, contradictions between village and university, and controversy \nover 'foreign' ideologies such as feminism. \nAll of these structured the consequences of the love between Ete Kamba \nand Nko. The pair had intercourse one night outside the village, and \nafterwards he was consumed with worry over whether Nko was or was not \nstill a virgin, since they had had intercourse with their clothes on and \nstanding up. It was crucial to him that she was still a virgin ifhe was to marry \nher. Nko refused to answer his obsessive questions about her virginity. \nInstead of images of matrilineality linking mother and daughter or of the \ncommunity of women as co-wives as emblems of collective unity, a \ndeconstruction of 'virginity' structures this novel's arguments about origins, \n",

An editorial \ngroup from Das Argument had undertaken an ambitious project to \ntranslate the multi-volume Dictionnaire Critique du Marxism (Labica and \nBenussen, Ig85) into German and also to prepare a separate German \nsupplement that brought in especially the new social movements that were \nnot treated in the French edition.' These movements have produced a \nrevolution in critical social theory internationally in the last twenty years. \nThey have also produced - and been partly produced by - revolutions in \npolitical language in the same period. As Riithzel expressed it, 'We, that is \nthe women's editorial group, are going to suggest some keywords which are \nmissing, and we want some others rewritten because the women do not \nappear where they should' (personal communication, 2 December Ig83). \nThis gentle understatement identified a major arena of feminist struggle -\nthe canonization oflanguage, politics, and historical narratives in publishing \npractices, including standard reference works. \n'The women do not appear where they should.' The ambiguities of the \nstatement were potent and tempting. Here was an opportunity to participate \nin producing a reference text. I had up to five typed pages for my assignment: \nsex/gender. Foolhardy, I wrote to accept the task. \nThere was an immediate problem: I am anglophone, with variously \nworkable but troubled German, French, and Spanish. This crippled lan-\nguage accomplishment reflects my political location in a social world \ndistorted by US hegemonic projects and the culpable ignorance of white, \nespecially, US citizens. English, especially American English, distinguishes \nbetween sex and gender. That distinction has cost blood in struggle in many \nsocial arenas, as the reader will see in the discussion that follows.

The \nspecific histories of women's movement in the vast global areas where these \nlanguages were part of living politics were principal reasons for the \ndifferences. The old hegemonic grammarians - including the sexologists-\nhad lost control of gender and its proliferating siblings. Europe and North \nAmerica could not begin to discipline the twentieth-century fate of its \nimperializing languages. However, I did not have a clue what to make of my \nsex/gender problem in Russian or Chinese. Progressively, it became clear to \nme that I had rather few clues what to make of sex/gender in English, even in \nthe United States, much less in the anglophone world. There are so many \nEnglishes in the United States alone, and all of them suddenly seemed \ngermane to this promised five-page text for a German Marxist dictionary \nthat was splitting off from its French parent in order to pay attention to new \nsocial movements. My English was marked by race, generation, gender (!), \nregion, class, education, and political history. How could that English be my \nmatrix for sex! gender i71 general?

That helped; there was a specific \ntextual locus for the first use of the term - Gayle Rubin's (1975) stunning \nessay written when she was a graduate student at the University of Michigan, \n'The traffic in women: notes on the political economy of sex'. I could just \ntrace the fate of the 'sex/gender system' in the explosion of socialist and \nMarxist feminist writing indebted to Rubin. That thought provided very \nbrief consolation. First, the editors directed that each keyword had to locate \nitself in relation to the corpus of Marx and Engels, whether or not they used \nthe precise words. I think Marx would have been amused at the dead hand \nguiding the living cursor on the video display terminal. Second, those who \nadopted Rubin's formulation did so out of many histories, including \nacademic and political interests.

In addition, there is as \nmuch reason for feminists to argue for a race/gender system as for a \nsex/gender system, and the two are not the same ki7ld of analytical move. \nAnd, again, what happened to class?

An obsolete \nEnglish meaning of 'to gender' is 'to copulate' (Oxford Etlglish Dictiotlary). \nThe substantives 'Geschlecht', 'gender', 'genre', and 'genera' refer to the \nnotion of sort, kind, and class. In English, 'gender' has been used in this \n'generic' sense continuously since at least the fourteenth century. In French, \nGerman, Spanish, and English, words for 'gender' refer to grammatical and \nliterary categories. The modern English and German words, 'gender' and \n'Geschlecht', adhere closely to concepts of sex, sexuality, sexual difference, \ngeneration, engendering, and so on, while the French and Spanish seem not \nto carry those meanings as readily. Words close to 'gender' are implicated in \nconcepts of kinship, race, biological taxonomy, language, and nationality. \nThe substantive 'Geschlecht' carries the meanings of sex, stock, race, and \nfamily, while the adjectival form 'geschlechtlich' means in English transla-\ntion both sexual and generic. 'Gender' is at the heart of constructions and \nclassifications of systems of difference. Complex differentiation and merging \nof terms for 'sex' and 'gender' are part of the political history of the words. \nMedical meanings related to 'sex' accrue to 'gender' in English progressively \nthrough the twentieth century. Medical, zoological, grammatical, and literary \nmeanings have all been contested in modern feminisms. The shared \ncategorical racial and sexual meanings of gender point to the interwoven \nmodern histories of colonial, racist, and sexual oppressions in systems of \nbodily production and inscription and their consequent liberatory and \noppositional discourses. The difficulty of accommodating racial and sexual \noppressions in Marxist theories of class is paralleled in the history of the \nwords themselves. This background is essential to understanding the \nresonances of the theoretical concept of the 'sex-gender system' constructed \nby Western anglophone feminists in the 1970S: In all their versions, \nfeminist gender theories attempt to articulate the specificity of the oppres-\nsions of women in the context of cultures which make a distinction between \nsex and gender salient. That salience depends on a related system of \nmeanings clustered around a family of binary pairs: nature/culture, nature! \nhistory, naturaVhuman, resource/product. This interdependence on a key \nWestern political-philosophical field of binary oppositions - whether under-\nstood functionally, dialectically, structurally, or psychoanalytically - prob-\nlematizes claims to the universal applicability of the concepts around sex and \ngender; this issue is part of the current debate about the cross-cultural \nrelevance of Euro-American versions of feminist theory (Strathern, 1988). \nThe value of an analytical category is not necessarily annulled by critical \nconsciousness of its historical specificity and cultural limits. But feminist \nconcepts of gender raise sharply the problems of cultural comparison, \nlinguistic translation, and political solidarity.] \n",

The modern feminist concept for gender is \nnot found in the writings of Marx and Engels, although their writings and \nother practice, and those of others in the Marxist tradition, have provided \ncrucial tools for, as well as barriers against, the later politicization and \ntheorization of gender. Despite important differences, all the modern \nfeminist meanings of gender have roots in Simone de Beauvoir's claim that \n'one is not born a woman' (de Beauvoir, 1949; 1952, p. 249) and in \npost-Second World War social conditions that have enabled constructions of \nwomen as a collective historical subject-in-process. Gender is a concept \ndeveloped to contest the naturalization of sexual difference in multiple \narenas of struggle. Feminist theory and practice around gender seek to \n\",plain and change historical systems of sexual difference, whereby 'men' \nand 'women' are socially constituted and positioned in relations of hierarchy \nand antagonism. Since the concept of gender is so closely related to the \n\\Vestem distinction between nature and society or nature and history, via the \ndistinction between sex and gender, the relation of feminist gender theories \nto Marxism is tied to the fate of the concepts of nature and labour in the \nMarxist canon and in Western philosophy more broadly. \nTraditional Marxist approaches did not lead to a political concept of \nge~der for two major reasons: first, women, as well as 'tribal' peoples, \neXIsted unstably at the boundary of the natural and social in the seminal \nwritings of Marx and Engels, such that their efforts to account for the \nsubordinate position of women were undercut by the category of the natural \nsexual division of labour, with its ground in an un examinable natural \nheterosexuality; and second, Marx and Engels theorized the economic \nproperty relation as the ground of the oppression of women in marriage, \nsuch that women's subordination could be examined in terms of the \ncapitalist relations of class, but not in terms of a specific sexual politics \nbetween men and women. The classical location of this argument is Engels' \n17Ie OrigitlS oJ tlze Family, Private Property alld tlze State (1884). Engels' \nanalytic priority of the family as a mediating formation between classes and \nthe state 'subsumed any separate consideration of the division of the sexes as \nan antagonistic division' (Coward, 1983, p. 160).5 Despite their insistence on \nthe historical variability of family forms and the importance of the question \nof the subordination of women, Marx and Engels could not historicize sex \nand gender from a base of natural heterosexuality. \n17Ie Gerolatl Ideology (Part I, Theses on Feuerbach) is the major locus for \n",

In T71e Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts ofI844, Marx refers to the \nrelation of man and woman as the 'most natural relation of human being to \nhuman being' (Marx, 1964b, p. '34). This assumption persists in volume \none of Capital (Marx, 1964a, p. 35 I). This inability fully to historicize \nwomen's labour is paradoxical in view of the purpose of The Gennan Ideology \nand subsequent work to place the family centrally in history as the place \nwhere social divisions arise. The root difficulty was an inability to historicize \nsex itself; like nature, sex functioned analytically as a prime matter or raw \nmaterial for the work of history. Relying on Marx's research on ethnographic \nwritings (1972), Engels' Origi\"s (1884) systematized Marx's views about the \nlinked transitions of family, forms of property, the organization of the \ndivision oflabour, and the state. Engels almost laid a basis for theorizing the \nspecific oppressions of women in his brief assertion that a fully materialist \nanalysis of the production and reproduction of immediate life reveals a \ntwofold character: the production of the means of existence and 'th, \nproductio\" of Imma\" bei\"gs tlzemselves' (1884; 1972, p. 71). An exploration of \nthis latter character has been the starting point for many Euro-American \nMarxist-feminists in their theories of the sex/gender division of labour.6 \nThe 'woman question' was widely debated in the many European Marxist \nparties in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the context of \nthe German Social Democratic Party the other of the two most influential \nMarxist treatments of the position of women was written, August Bebel's \nWoman u\"der Socialism (1883; orig. Women in tlze Past, Present and Future, \n1878). Alexandra Kollontai drew on Bebel in her struggles for women's \nemancipation in Russia and the Soviet Union; and within German social \ndemocracy, Clara Zetkin, a leader of the International Socialist Women's \nMovement, developed Bebel's position in her 1889 'The Question of \nWomen Workers and Women at the Present Timed \nCurrent Problematic \nTize gender identity paradigm The story of the political reformulations of \ngender by post-1960s Western feminists must pass through the construction \nof meanings and technologies of sex and gender in normalizing, liberal, \ninterventionist-therapeutic, empiricist, and functionalist life sciences, prin~ \ncipally in the United States, including psychology, psychoanalysis, medicine, \nbiology, and sociology.

The \nconcepts and technologies of 'gender identity' were crafted from several \ncomponents: an instinctualist reading of Freud; the focus on sexual somatic-\nand psychopathology by the great nineteenth-century sexologists (Krafft-\nEbing, Havelock Ellis) and their followers; the ongoing development of \nbiochemical and physiological endocrinology from the '920S; the psycho-\nbiology of sex differences growing out of comparative psychology; proliferat-\ning hypotheses of hormonal, chromosomal, and neural sexual dimorphism \nconverging in the 19Sos; and the first gender reassignment surgeries around \n1960 (Linden, 1981). 'Second-wave' feminist politics around 'biological \ndeterminism' vs. 'social constructionism' and the biopolitics of sex/gender \nditTerences occur within discursive fields pre-structured by the gender \nidentity paradigm crystallized in the 19SoS and 60S. The gender identity \nparadigm was a functionalist and essentializing version of Simone de \nBeauvoir's 1940S insight that one is not born a woman. Significantly, the \nconstruction of what could count as a woman (or a man) became a problem \nfor bourgeois functionalists and pre-feminist existentialists in the same \nhistorical post-war period in which the social foundations of women's lives in \na world capitalist, male-dominant system were undergoing basic reformula-\ntions. \nIn 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) medical cenIer for the study \nof intersexuals and transexuals. The psychoanalyst Robert Stoller's work \n(1968, 1976) discussed and generalized the findings of the UCLA projecl. \nStoller (1964) introduced the term 'gender identity' to the International \nPsychoanalytic Congress at Stockholm in '963. He formulated the concept \nof gender identity within the framework of the biology/culture distinction, \nsuch that sex was related to biology (hormones, genes, nervous system, \nmorphology) and gender was related to culture (psychology, sociology). The \nproduct of culture's working of biology was the core, achieved, gendered \nperson - a man or a woman. Beginning in the I950s, the psychoendocrin-\nologist, John Money, ultimately from the institutional base of the Johns \nHopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established 1965), with \nhis colleague, Anke Ehrhardt, developed and popularized the interactionist \nversion of the gender identity paradigm, in which the functionalist mix of \nbiological and social causations made room for a myriad of 'sex/gender \ndifferences' research and therapeutic programmes, including surgery, coun-\nselling, pedagogy, social services, and so on.

These refonnulatio!l5 \nfailed to interrogate the political-social history of binary categories like \nnature/culture, and so sex/gender, in colonialist Western discourse. This \ndiscourse structured the world as an object of knowledge in tenns of the \nappropriation by culture of the resources of nature. Many recent opposition-\nal,liberatory literatures have criticized this ethnocentric epistemological and \nlinguistic dimension of the domination of those inhabiting 'natural' categor-\nies or living at the mediating boundaries of the binarisms (women, people of \ncolour, animals, the non-human environment) (Harding, 1986, pp. 163-96; \nFee, 1986). Second-wave feminists early criticized the binary logics of the \nnature/culture pair, including dialectical versions of the Marxist-humanist \nstory of the domination, appropriation, or mediation of 'nature' by 'man' \nthrough 'labour'. But these efforts hesitated to extend their criticism fully to \nthe derivative sex/gender distinction. That distinction was too useful in \ncombating the pervasive biological detenninisms constantly deployed against \nfeminists in urgent 'sex differences' political struggles in schools, publishing \nhouses, clinics, and so on. Fatally, in this constrained political climate, these \nearly critiques did not focus on historicizing and culturally relativizing the \n'passive' categories of sex or nature. Thus, fonnulations of an essential \nidentity as a woman or a man were left analytically untouched and politically \ndangerous. \nIn the political and epistemological effort to remove \\vomen from the \ncategory of nature and to place them in culture as constructed and \nself-constructing social subjects in history, the concept of gender has tended \nto be quarantined from the infections of biological sex. Consequently, the \nongoing constructions of what counts as sex or as female have been hard to \ntheorize, except as 'bad science' where the female emerges as naturally \nsubordinate. 'Biology' has tended to denote the body itself, rather than a \nsocial discourse open to intervention. Thus, feminists have argued against \n'biological detenninism' and for 'social constructionism' and in the process \nhave been less powerful in deconstructing how bodies, including sexualized \nand racialized bodies, appear as objects of knowledge and sites of interven-\ntion in 'biology'. Alternatively, feminists have sometimes aflinned the \ncategories of nature and the body as sites of resistance to the dominations of \nhistory, but the aflinnations have tended to obscure the categorical and \noverdetermined aspect of 'nature' or the 'female body' as an oppositional \nideological resource. Instead, nature has seemed simply there, a reserve to \nbe preserved from the violations of civilization in general. Rather than \nmarking a categorically determined pole, 'nature' or 'woman's body' too \neasily then means the saving core of reality distinguishable from the social \n",

The task is to 'disqualifY' the analytic categories,like sex or nature, that \nlead to univocity. This move would expose the illusion of an interior \norganizing gender core and produce a field of race and gender difference \nopen to resignification. Many feminists have resisted moves like those Butler \nrecommends, for fear oflosing a concept of agency for women as the concept \nof the subject withers under the attack on core identities and their \nconstitutive fictions. Butler, however, argued that agency is an instituted \npractice in a field of enabling constraints. A concept of a coherent inner self, \nachieved (cultural) or innate (biological), is a regulatory fiction that is \nunnecessary - indeed, inhibitory - for feminist projects of producing and \naffirming complex agency and responsibility. \nA related 'regulatory fiction' basic to Western concepts of gender insists \nthat motherhood is natural and fatherhood is cultural: mothers make babies \nnaturally, biologically. Motherhood is known on sight; fatherhood is infer-\nred. Analysing gender concepts and practices among Melanesians, Strathern \n(1988, pp. 311-39) went to great pains to show both the ethnocentric quality \nof the self-evident Western assertion that 'women make babies' and the \ninferential character of all vision. She showed the productionist core of the \nbelief that women make babies (and its pair, that man makes himself), which \nis intrinsic to Western fonnulations of sex and gender. Strathern argued that \nHagen men and women do not exist in permanent states as subjects and \nobjects within Aristotelian, Hegelian, Marxist, or Freudian frames. Hagen \nagency has a different dynamic and geometry. For Westerners, it is a central \nconsequence of concepts of gender difference that a person may be turned \nby another person into an object and robbed of her or his status as subject. \nThe proper state for a Western person is to have ownership of the self, to \nhave and hold a core identity as if it were a possession. That possession may \nbe made from various raw materials over time, that is, it may be a cultural \nproduction, or one may be born with it. Gender identity is such a possession. \nNot to have property in the self is not to be a subject, and so not to have \nagency. Agency follows different pathways for the Hagen, who as persons \n'are composed of multiple gendered parts, or multiple gendered persons, \nwho are interacting with one another as donors and recipients in maintaining \n",

Sexist \ndomination between persons can and does systematically occur, but it cannot \nbe traced or addressed by the same analytical moves that would be \nappropriate for many Western social fields of meaning (Strathern, 1988, pp. \n334-9). Butler could - cautiously - use Strathern's ethnographic arguments \nto illustrate one way to disperse the coherence of gender without losing the \npower of agency. \nSo, the ongoing tactical usefulness of the sex/gender distinction in life and \nsocial sciences has had dire consequences for much feminist theory, tying it \nto a liberal and functionalist paradigm despite repeated efforts to transcend \nthose limits in a fully politicized and historicized concept of gender. The \nfailure lay partly in not hlstoricizing and relativizing sex and the historical-\nepistemological roots of the logic of analysis implied in the sex/gender \ndistinction and in each member of the pair. At this level, the modem feminist \niimitation in theorizing and struggling for the empirical life and social \nsciences is similar to Marx and Engels' inability to extricate themselves from \nthe natural sexual division of labour in heterosexuality despite their admir-\nable project of historicizing the family. \nSex/gender differences discourse exploded in US sociological and \npsychological literature in the 1970S and 80S.

The explosion is part of a vigorous political and scientific \ncontestation over the construction of sex and gender, as categories and as \nemergent historical realities, in which feminist writing becomes prominent \nabout the mid-1970S, primarily in criticisms of ' biological determinism' and \nof sexist science and technology, especially biology and medicine. Set up \nwithin the epistemological binary framework of nature/culture and sex! \ngender, many feminists (including socialist and Marxist feminists) appropri-\nated the sex/gender distinction and the interactionist paradigm to argue for \nthe primacy of culture-gender over biology-sex in a panoply of debates in \nEurope and the United States. These debates have ranged from genetic \ndifferences in mathematics ability of boys and girls, the presence and \nsignificance of sex differences in neural organization, the relevance of animal \nresearch to human behaviour, the causes of male dominance in the \norganization of scientific research, sexist structures and use patterns in \nlanguage, sociobiology debates, struggles over the meanings of sex chromo-\nsomal abnormalities, to the similarities of racism and sexism.

Her paper appeared in the first anthology of socialist! \nMarxist feminist anthropology in the United States. Rubin and those \nindebted to her theorization adopted a version of the nature/culture \ndistinction, but one flowing less out of US empiricist life and social science, \nand more from French psychoanalysis and structuralism. Rubin examined \nthe 'domestication of women', in which human females were the raw \nmaterials for the social production of women, through the exchange systems \nof kinship controlled by men in the institution of human culture. She defined \nthe sex-gender system as the system of social relations that transformed \nbiological sexuality into products of human activity and in which the \nresulting historically specific sexual needs are met. She then called for a \nMarxian analysis of sex/gender systems as products of human activity which \nare changeable through political struggle. Rubin viewed the sexual division \nof labour and the psychological construction of desire (especially the oedipal \nformation) as the foundations of a system of production of human beings \nvesting men with rights in women which they do not have in themselves. To \nsurvive materially where men and women cannot perfonn the other's work \nand to satisfY deep structures of desire in the sex/gender system in which \nmen exchange women, heterosexuality is obligatory.

Like race, sex \nis an 'imaginary' formation of the kind that produces reality, including bodies \nthen perceived as prior to all construction. 'Woman' only exists as this kind \nof imaginary being, while women are the product of a social relation of \nappropriation, naturalized as sex. A feminist is one who fights for women as a \nclass and for the disappearance of that class. The key struggle is for the \ndestruction of the social system of heterosexuality, because 'sex' is the \nnaturalized political category that founds society as heterosexual. All the \nsocial sciences based on the category of 'sex' (most of them) must be \noverthrown. In this view, lesbians are not 'women' because they are outside \nthe political economy of heterosexuality. Lesbian society destroys women as \na natural group (Wittig, Ig81). \nThus, theorized in three different frames, withdrawal from marriage was \ncentral to Rubin's, Rich's, and Wittig's political visions in the 1970S and \nearly 80S. Marriage encapsulated and reproduced the antagonistic relation of \nthe two coherent social groups, men and women. In all three formulations \nboth the binary of nature/culture and the dynamic of production ism enabled \nthe further analysis. Withdrawal of women from the marriage economy was a \npotent figure and politics for withdrawal from men, and therefore for the \nself-constitution of women as personal and historical subjects outside the \ninstitution of culture by men in the exchange and appropriation of the \nproducts (including babies) of women. To be a subject in the Western sense \nmeant reconstituting women outside the relations of objectification (as gift, \ncommodity, object of desire) and appropriation (of babies, sex, services). \nThe category-defining relation of men and women in objectification, \nexchange, and appropriation, which was the theoretical key to the category \n'gender' in major bodies of feminist theory by white women in this period, \nwas one of the moves that made an understanding of the race/gender or \nrace/sex system and the barriers to cross-racial 'sisterhood' hard for white \nfeminists analytically to grasp. \nHowever, these formulations had the powerful virtue of foregrounding \nand legitimating lesbianism at the heart of feminism. The figure of the \nlesbian has been repeatedly at the contentious, generative centre of feminist \ndebate (King, 1986). Audre Lorde put the black lesbian at the heart of her \nunderstanding of the 'house of difference': \nBeing women together was not enough. We were different.

It was a while before we came to \nrealize that our place was the very house of difference rather than the \nsecurity of anyone particular difference. (Lorde, 1982, p. 226) \nThis concept of difference grounded much US multi-cultural feminist \ntheorizing on gender in the late 1980s. \nThere have been many uses and criticisms of Rubin's sex-gender system. \nIn an article at the centre of much Euro-American Marxist and socialist-\nfeminist debate, Hartmann (1981) insisted that patriarchy was not simply an \nideology, as Juliet Mitchell seemed to argue in her seminal 'Women: the \nLongest Revolution' (1966) and its expansion in Women's Estate (1971), but a \nmaterial system that could be defined 'as a set of social relations between \nmen, which have a material base, and which, though hierarchical, establish \nor create interdependence and solidarity among men that enable them to \ndominate women' (Hartmann, 198 I, p. 14). Within this frame, Hartmann \nattempted to explain the partnership of patriarchy and capital and the failure \nof male-dominated socialist labour movements to prioritize sexism. Hart-\nmann used Rubin's concept of the sex-gender system to call for an \nunderstanding of the mode of production of human beings in patriarchal \nsocial relations through male control of women's labour power. \nIn the debate stimulated by Hartmann's thesis, Iris Young (1981) \ncriticized the 'dual systems' approach to capital and patriarchy, which were \nthen allied in the oppressions of class and gender. Note how race, including \nan interrogation of white racial positioning, remained an unexplored system \nin these formulations. Young argued that 'patriarchal relations are internally \nrelated to production relations as a whole' (1981, p. 49), such that a focus on \nthe gender division of labour could reveal the dynamics of a single system of \noppression. In addition to waged labour, the gender division of labour also \nincluded the excluded and unhistoricized labour categories in Marx and \nEngels, that is, bearing and rearing children, caring for the sick, cooking, \nhousework, and sex-work like prostitution, in order to bring gender and \nwomen's specific situation to the centre of historical materialist analysis. In \nthis theory, since the gender division of labour was also the first division of \nlabour, one must give an account of the emergence of class society out of \nchanges in the gender division oflabour. Such an analysis does not posit that \nall women have a common, unified situation; but it makes the historically \ndifferentiated positions of women central. If capitalism and patriarchy are a \nsingle system, called capitalist patriarchy, then the struggle against class and \ngender oppressions must be unified. The struggle is the obligation of men \nand women, although autonomous women's organization would remain a \npractical necessity. This theory is a good example of strongly rationalist, \n",

But Hartsock \nrejected the terminology of the gender division of labour in favour of the \nsexual division of labour, in order to emphasize the bodily dimensions of \nwomen's activity. Hartsock was also critical of Rubin's formulation of the \nsex-gender system because it emphasized the exchange system of kinship at \nthe expense of a materialist analysis of the labour process that grounded \nwomen's potential construction of a revolutionary standpoint. Hartsock \nrelied on versions of Marxist humanism embedded in the story of human \nself-formation in the sensuous mediations of nature and humanity through \nlabour.

In \nextending her approach to the sex-gender system to The Science Question in \nFeminism (1986), Harding stressed three variously interrelated elements of \ngender: (I) a fundamental category through which meaning is ascribed to \neverything, (2) a way of organizing social relations, and (3) a structure of \npersonal identity.

Using the sex-gender system to explore post-Second \nWorld War politics of sexual identity in gay movements, Jeffrey Escoffier \n(1985) argued for a need to theorize the emergence and linnitations of new \nforms of political subjectivity, in order to develop a committed, positioned \npolitics without metaphysical identity closures. Haraway's (1985) 'Manifesto \nfor Cyborgs' (see this volume, pp. 149-8,) developed similar arguments in \norder to explore Marxist-feminist politics addressed to women's positionings \nin multi-national science- and technology-mediated social, cultural, and \ntechnical systems. \nIn another' theoretical development indebted to Marxism, while critical of \nboth it and of the language of gender, Catherine MacKinnon (1982, p. 515) \nargued that \nSexuality is to feminism what work is to marxism: that which is most one's \nown, yet most taken away ... Sexuality is that social process which \ncreates, organizes, expresses, and directs desire, creating the social beings \nwe know as women and men, as their relations create society ... As the \norganized expropriation of the work of some for the benefit of others \ndefines a class - workers - the organi2ed expropriation of the sexuality of \nsome for the use of other defines the sex, woman. \nMacKinnon's position has been central to controversial approaches to \npolitical action in much of the US movement against pornography, defined \nas violence against women and/or as a violation of women's civil rights; that \nis, a refusal to women, via their construction as woman, of the status of \ncitizen. MacKinnon saw the construction of woman as the material and \nideological construction of the object of another's desire. Thus women are \nnot sinnply alienated from the product of their labour; in so far as they exist as \n'woman', that is to say, sex objects, they are not even potentially historical \nsubjects. 'For women, there is no distinction between objectification and \nalienation because women have not authored objectifications, we have been \nthem' (1982, pp. 253-4). The epistemological and political consequences of \nthis position are far reaching and have been extremely controversial. For \nMacKinnon, the production of women is the production of a very material \nillusion, 'woman'. Unpacking this material illusion, which is women's lived \nreality, requires a politics of consciousness-raising, the specific form of \nfeminist politics in MacKinnon's frame. 'Sexuality determines gender', and \n'women's sexuality is its use, just as our femaleness is its alterity' (p. 243). \nLike independent formulations in Lacanian feminisms, MacKinnon's posi-\ntion has been fruitful in theorizing processes of representation, in which \n'power to create the world from one's point of view is power in its male form' \n(p. 249)· \n",

De Lauretis defined \ngender as the social construction of 'woman' and 'man' and the semiotic \nproduction of subjectivity; gender has to do with 'the history, practices, and \nimbrication of meaning and experience'; that is, with the 'mutually constitu-\ntive effects in semiosis of the outer world of social reality with the inner \nworld of subjectivity' (1984, pp. 158-86). De Lauretis drew on Charles \nPeirce's theories of semiosis to develop an approach to 'experience', one of \nthe most problematic notions in modern feminism, that takes account both of \nexperience's intimate embodiment and its mediation through signitying \npractices. Experience is never im-mediately accessible. Her efforts have \nbeen particularly helpful in understanding and contesting inscriptions of \ngender in cinema and other areas where the idea that gender is an embodied \nsemiotic difference is crucial and empowering. Differentiating technologies \nof gender from Foucault's formulation of technologies of sex, de Lauretis \nidentified a specific feminist gendered subject position within sex/gender \nsystems. Her formulation echoed Lorde's understanding of the inhabitant of \nthe house of difference: 'The female subject of feminism is one constructed \nacross a multiplicity of discourses, positions, and meanings, which are often \nin conflict with one another and inherently (historically) contradictory' (de \nLauretis, 1987, pp. ix-x). \nOffering a very different theory of consciousness and the production of \nmeanings from MacKinnon or de Lauretis, Hartsock's (1983a) exploration \nof the sexual division of labour drew on anglophone versions of psychoana-\nlysis that were particularly important in US feminist theory, that is, object \nrelations theory as developed especially by Nancy Chodorow (1978). \nWithout adopting Rubin's Lacanian theories of always fragmentary sexed \nsubjectivity, Chodorow adopted the concept of the sex-gender system in her \nstudy of the social organization of parenting, which produced women more \ncapable of non-hostile relationality than men, but which also perpetuated the \nsubordinate position of women through their production as people who are \nstructured for mothering in patriarchy. Preferring an object relations \npsychoanalysis over a Lacanian version is related to neighbouring concepts \nlike 'gender identity', with its empirical social science web of meanings, over \n'acquisition of positions of sexed subjectivity', with this concept's immersion \nin Continental culturaVtextual theory. Although criticized as an essentializ-\ning of woman-as-relational, Chodorow's feminist object relations theory has \nbeen immensely influential, having been adapted to explore a wide range of \nsocial phenomena.

Keller foregrounded the logical \nmistake of equating women with gender. II Gender is a system of social, \nsymbolic, and psychic relations, in which men and women are differentially \npositioned. Looking at the expression of gender as a cognitive experience, in \nwhich masculine psychic individuation produces an investment in imperson-\nality, objectification, and domination, Keller described her project as an \neffort to understand the 'science-gender system' (p. 8). Emphasizing social \nconstruction and concentrating on psychodynamic aspects of that construc-\ntion, Keller took as her subject 'not women per SC, or even women and \nscience: it is the making of men, women, and science, or, more precisely, \nhow the making of men and women has affected the making of science' \n(p. 4). Her goal was to work for science as a human project, not a masculine \nonc. She phrased her question as, 'Is sex to gender as nature is to science?' \n(Keller, 1987). \nChodorow's early work was deVeloped in the context of a related series of \nsociological and anthropological papers theorizing a key role for the \npublic/private division in the subordination of women (Rosaldo and Lam-\nphere, 1974). In that collection, Rosaldo argued the universal salience of the \nUntitation of women to the domestic realm, while power was vested in the \nspace men inhabit, called public. Sherry Ortner connected that approach to \nher structuralist analysis of the proposition that women are to nature as men \nare to culture. Many Euro-American feminist efforts to articulate the social \npositioning of women that followed Woman, Culture, and Society and Toward \nall Anthropology o[Women (Reiter, 1975), both strategically published in the \nmid- I 970s, were deeply influenced by the universalizing and powerful \ntheories of sex and gender of those early collections. In anthropology as a \ndiscipline, criticisms and other outgrowths of the early formulations were \nrich, leading both to extensive cross-cultural study of gender symbolisms \nand to fundamental rejection of the universal applicability of the nature/ \nculture pair. Within the disciplines, there was growing criticism of universal-\nizing explanations as an instance of mistaking the analytical tool for the \nreality (MacCormack and Strathern, 1980; Rosaldo, 1980; Ortner and \nWhitehead 1981; Rubin, 1984). As feminist anthropology moved away from \nits early formulations, they none the less persisted in much feminist discourse \noutside anthropological disciplinary circles, as if the mid-197oS positions \nwere permanently authoritative feminist anthropological theory, rather than \na discursive node in a specific political-historical-disciplinary moment. \n",

The category of gender \nobscured or subordinated all the other 'others'. Efforts to use Western or \n'white' concepts of gender to characterize a 'Third World Woman' often \nresulted in reproducing orientalist, racist, and colonialist discourse (Mohan-\nty, 1984; Amos el ai., 1984). Furthermore, US 'women of colour', itself a \ncomplex and contested political construction of sexed identities, produced \ncritical theory about the production of systems of hierarchical differences, in \nwhich race, nationality, sex, and class were intertwined, both in the \nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries and from the earliest days of the \nwomen's movements that emerged from the 1960s civil rights and anti-war \nmovements.12 These theories of the social positioning of women ground and \norganize 'generic' feminist theory, in which concepts like 'the house of \ndifference' (Lorde), 'oppositional consciousness' (Sandoval), 'womanism' \n(Walker), 'shuttle from center to margin' (Spivak), 'Third World feminism' \n(Moraga and Smith), 'el mundo zurdo' (Anzaldua and Moraga), 'la mestiza' \n(Anzaldua), 'racially-structured patriarchal capitalism' (Bhavnani and Coul-\nson, 1986), and 'inappropriate/d other' (Trinh, 1986-7, 1989) structure the \nfield of feminist discourse, as it decodes what counts as a 'woman' within as \nwell as outside 'feminism'. Complexly related figures have emerged also in \nfeminist writing by 'white' women: 'sex-political classes' (Sofoulis, 1987); \n'cyborg' (Haraway, 1985 and this voL pp. 149-81); the female subject of \nfeminism (de Lauretis, 1987). \nIn the early 1980s, Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press was established \nin New York and began to publish the critical theoretical and other writings \nof radical women of colour. This development must be seen in the context of \ninternational publishing in many genres by women writing into conscious-\nness the stories of their constructions, and thereby destabilizing the canons \nof Western feminism, as well as those of many other discourses. As the \nheterogeneous and critical subject positions of 'women of colour' were \nprogressively elaborated in diverse publishing practices, the status of 'white' \nor 'Western' also was more readily seen as a contestable location and not as a \ngiven ethnicity, race, or inescapable destiny. Thus, 'white' women could be \ncalled to account for their active positioning. \nRubin's 1975 theory of the sex/gender system explained the com-\nplementarity of the sexes (obligatory heterosexuality) and the oppression of \nwomen by men through the central premise of the exchange of women in the \nfounding of culture through kinship.

If kinship vested men \nwith rights in women that they did not have in themselves, slavery abolished \nkinship for one group in a legal discourse that produced whole groups of \npeople as alienable property (Spillers, 1987).

As \nHurtado (1989, p. 841) noted, in the nineteenth century prominent white \nfeminists were //lamed to white men, while black feminists were owned by \nwhite men. In a racist patriarchy, white men's 'need' for racially pure \noffspring positioned free and unfree women in incompatible, asymmetrical \nsymbolic and social spaces. \nThe female slave was marked with these differences in a most literal \nfashion - the flesh was turned inside out, 'addling] a lexical dimension to the \nnarratives of woman in culture and society' (Spillers, 1987, pp. 67-8).

Slave \nmothers could not transmit a name; they could not be wives; they were \noutside the system of marriage exchange.

In \nthese discursive frames, white women were not legally or symbolically ji,/Iy \nhuman; slaves were not legally or symbolicallY human at all. 'In this absence \nfrom a subject position, the captured sexualities provide a physical and \nbiological expression of \"otherness\"' (Spillers, '987, p. 67). To give birth \n(unfreely) to the heirs of property is not the same thing as to give birth \n(unfreely) to property (Carby, '987, p. 53). \nThis little difference is part of the reason that 'reproductive rights' for \nwomen of colour in the US prominendy hinge on comprehensive control of \nchildren - for example, their freedom from destruction through lynching, \nimprisonment, infant mortality, forced pregnancy, coercive sterilization, \ninadequate housing, racist education, or drug addiction (Hurtado, 1989, p. \n853). For white women the concept of property in the self, the ownership of \none's own body, in relation to reproductive freedom has more readily \nfocused on the field of events around conception, pregnancy, abortion, and \nbirth, because the system of white patriarchy turned on the control of \nlegitimate children and the consequent constitution of white females as \nwoman. To have or not have children then becomes literally a subject-\ndefining choice for women. Black women specifically - and the women \nsubjected to the conquest of the New World in general - faced a broader \nsocial field of reproductive unfreedom, in which their children did not \ninherit the status of human in the founding hegemonic discourses of US \nsociety. The problem of the black mother in this context is not simply her \nown status as subject, but also the status of her children and her sexual \npartners, male and female. Small wonder that the image of uplifting the race \nand the refusal of the categorical separation of men and women - without \nflinching from an analysis of coloured and white sexist oppression - have \nbeen prominent in New World black feminist discourse (Carby, 1987, pp. \n6-7; hooks, 1981, 1984). \nThe positionings of African-American women are not the same as those \nof other women of colour; each condition of oppression requires specific \nanalysis that refuses the separations but insists on the non-identities of race, \nsex, and class. These matters make starkly clear why an adequate feminist \ntheory of gender must simultaneously be a theory of racial difference in \nspecific historical conditions of production and reproduction.

It is also an effort to \ncontribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodemist, \nnon-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world \nwithout gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a \nworld without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. Nor \ndoes it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the tetrible \ncleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. \nAs Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, \nMelanie Klein, and nuclear culture, Lacklein, the most terrible and perhaps \nthe most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal \nnarratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand \nfor our survival. \nThe cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with \nbisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to \norganic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts \ninto a higher unity.

An origin story in the \n'Western', humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, \nbliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans \nmust separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin \npotent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and \nMarxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in \ntheir concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend \non the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and \nenlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg \nskips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western \nsense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its \nteleology as star wars. \nThe cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and \nperversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. No \nlonger structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a \ntechnological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, \nthe household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be \nthe resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The rela-\ntionships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and \nhierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes \nof Frankenstein's monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it \nthrough a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a \nheterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and \ncosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the \norganic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not \nrecognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of \nreturning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the \napocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the \nEnemy. Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They \nare wary of holism, but needy for connection- they seem to have a natural \nfeel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main \ntrouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of \nmilitarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But \nillegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their \nfathers, after all, are inessential. \nI will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter, but \nnow I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the \nfollowing political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible. By the late \ntwentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary between \nhuman and animal is thoroughly breached.

And many people no longer feel the need \nfor such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the \npleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements for \nanimal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are a \nclear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of \nnature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two \ncenturies have simultaneously produced modem organisms as objects of \nknowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace \nre-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and \nsocial science. Within this framework, teaching modem Christian creation-\nism should be fought as a form of child abuse. \nBiological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scient-\nific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much \nroom for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached \nboundary?

Late twentieth-century \nmachines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural \nand artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and \nmany other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our \nmachines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert. \nTechnological determination is only one ideological space opened up by \nthe reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we \nengage in the play of writing and reading the world.3 'Textualization' of \neverything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by \nMarxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived \nrelations of domination that ground the 'play' of arbitrary reading: It is \ncertainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert \nmyriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the \nbiological organism).

She notes that the definition of the group has been by \nconscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or US black \nwoman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or as a \nChicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities, left \nout of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called 'women and \nblacks', who claimed to make the imponant revolutions. The category \n'woman' negated all non-white women; 'black' negated all non-lilack people, \nas well as all black women. But there was also no 'she', no singularity, but a \nsea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical \nidentity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously \nconstructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of \nnatural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, \nof political kinship.\" Unlike the 'woman' of some streams of the white \nwomen's movement in the United States, there is no naturalization of the \nmatrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available through \nthe power of oppositional consciousness. \nSandoval's argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for \nfeminists out of the world-wide development of anti-colonialist discourse; \nthat is to say, discourse dissolving the 'West' and its highest product - the \none who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a \ncosmos called history.

In the fraying of identities and in the reflexive \nstrategies for constructing them, the possibility opens up for weaving \nsomething other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that so \nprophetically ends salvation history. \nBoth Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simul-\ntaneously naturalized and denatured the category 'woman' and conscious-\nness of the social lives of 'women'. Perhaps a schematic caricature can \nhighlight both kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of \nwage labour which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage \nrelationship is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his \n(sic) product. Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules \nin practice.

The main achievement of both Marxist \nfeminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of labour to \naccommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation was \nsubordinated to a more comprehensive view of labour under capitalist \npatriarchy. In particular, women's labour in the household and women's \nactivity as mothers generally (that is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist \nsense), entered theory on the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of \nlabour. The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the \nontological structure of ' labour'. Marxist/socialist-feminism does not 'natur-\nalize' unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint \nrooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological \nstructure oflabour or ofits analogue, women's activity.ll The inheritance of \nMarxian humanism, with its pre-eminently Western self, is the difficulty for \nme. The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the \ndaily responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize \nthem. \nCatherine MacKinnon's (1982, 1987) version of radical feminism is itself \na caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of \nWestern theories of identity grounding action. 12 It is factually and politically \nwrong to assimilate all of the diverse 'moments' or 'conversations' in recent \nwomen's politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon's version. But the \nteleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology-\nincluding their negations - erase or police difference.

That is, the totalization built into this tale of \nradical feminism achieves its end - the unity of women - by enforcing the \nexperience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/ \nsocialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And \nMacKinnon's theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist \nrevolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism. \nMacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a different analyt-\nical strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but at \nthe structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men's constitu-\ntion and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon's 'ontolo-\ngy' constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another's desire, not the self's \nlabour, is the origin of 'woman'. She therefore develops a theory of \nconsciousness that enforces what can count as 'women's' experience -\nanything that names sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as 'women' can \nbe concerned. Feminist practice is the construction of this form of \nconsciousness; that is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not. \nPerversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemolo-\ngical status oflabour; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able to \ncontribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual objectification, not \nalienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the realm of \nknowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and abstraction. \nHowever, a woman is not simply alienated from her product, but in a deep \nsense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes \nher existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted by \nanother's desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent \nseparation of the labourer from his product. \nMacKinnon's radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme; \nit does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other \nwomen's political speech and action. It is a totalization producing \nwhat Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing -\nfeminists' \nconsciousness of the non-existence of women, except as products of \nmen's desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version \nof identity can firmly ground women's unity. But in solving the problem \nof the contradictions of any Western revolutionary subject for feminist \npurposes, she develops an even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. \nIf my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended \nerasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in \nanti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all \ndifference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is \nnot reassuring. \nIn my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a re-inscription of \n",

There was nO structural room for race (or for much else) in \ntheory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman and social \ngroup women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure of my \ncaricature looks like this: \nsocialist feminism - structure of class / / wage labour / / alienation \nlabour, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race \nradieal feminism -\nstructure of gender / / sexual appropriation II \nobjectification \nsex, by analogy labour, by extension reproduction, by addition race \nIn another context, the French theorist, Julia Kristeva, claimed women \nappeared as a historical group after the Second World War, along with \ngroups like youth. Her dates are doubtful; but we are now accustomed to \nremembering that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, 'race' did \nnot always exist, 'class' has a historical genesis, and 'homosexuals' are quite \njunior. It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man - and \nso the essence of woman - breaks up at the same moment that networks of \nconnection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, \npregnant, and complex. 'Advanced capitalism' is inadequate to convey the \nstructure of this historical moment. In the 'Western' sense, the end of man ~ \nat stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates into women in our time. \nPerhaps socialist feminists were not substantially guilty of producing \nessentialist theory that suppressed women's particularity and contradictory \ninterests.

In each case, \nsolution to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the \nkey operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow of \na quantity called information.

The extreme mobility of \ncapital and the emerging international division oflabour are intertwined with \nthe emergence of new collectivities, and the weakening of familiar groupings. \nThese developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in \nadvanced industrial societies have become newly vulnerable to permanent \njob loss, and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates \nas men. It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the \npreferred labour force for the science-based multinationals in the export-\nprocessing sectors, particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic \nand involves reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumption, and production. \nIn the prototypical Silicon Valley, many women's lives have been structured \naround employment in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate \nrealities include serial heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, dis-\ntance from extended kin or most other forms of traditional community, a \nhigh likelihood ofloneliness and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. \nThe ethnic and racial diversity of women in Silicon Valley structures a \nmicrocosm of conflicting differences in culture, family, religion, education, \nand language. \nRichard Gordon has called this new situation the 'homework economy'.16 \nAlthough he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in \nconnection with electronics assembly, Gordon intends 'homework economi \nto name a restructuring of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly \nascribed to female jobs, jobs literally done only by women. Work is being \nredefmed as both literally female and feminized, whether performed by men \nor women. To be feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to \nbe disassembled, reassembled, exploited as a reserve labour force; seen less \nas workers than as servers; subjected to time arrangements on and ofT the \npaid job that make a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that \nalways borders on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. \nDeskilling is an old strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. \nHowever, the homework economy does not refer only to large-scale \ndeskilling, nor does it deny that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for \nwomen and men previously excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the \nconcept indicates that factory, home, and market are integrated on a new \nscale and that the places of women are crucial - and need to be analysed ror \ndifferences among women and for meanings for relations between men and \nwomen in various situations. \nThe homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is \nmade possible by (not caused by) the new technologies.

The consequences \nof the new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family \n(male) wage (if they ever had aCcess to this white privilege) and in the \ncharacter of their own jobs, which are becoming capital-intensive; for \nexample, office work and nursing. \nThe new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the \ncollapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on \nwomen to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and \nold people. The feminization of poverty - generated by dismantling the wel-\nfare state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the excep-\ntion, and sustained by the expectation that women's wages will not be matched \nby a male income for the support of children - has become an urgent focus. \nThe causes of various women-headed households are a function of race, \nclass, or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions of \nwomen on many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly as a \nfunction of their enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind of inte-\ngration with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy is \nnew. The particular pressure, for example, on US black women, who have \nachieved an escape from (barely) paid domestic service and who now hold \nclerical and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implications for \ncontinued enforced black poverty with employment. Teenage women in \nindustrializing areas of the Third World increasingly find themselves the \nsole or major source of a cash wage for their families, while access to land is \never more problematic. These developments must have major consequences \nin the psychodynamics and politics of gender and race. \nWithin the framework of three major stages of capitalism (commerciaV \nearly industrial, monopoly, multinational) - tied to nationalism, imperialism, \nand multinationalism, and related to Jameson's three dominant aesthetic \nperiods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism - I would argue that \nspecific forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its \npolitical and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and \nunequally, ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (I) the \npatriarchal nuclear family, structured by the dichotomy between public and \nprivate and accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres \nand nineteenth-century Anglo-American bourgeois feminism; (2) the mod-\nem family mediated (or enforced) by the welfare state and institutions like \nthe family wage, with a flowering of a-feminist heterosexual ideologies, \nincluding their radical versions represented in Greenwich Village around the \nFirst World War; and 6) the 'family' of the homework economy with its \noxymoronic structure of women-headed households and its explosion of \nfeminisms and the paradoxical intensification and erosion of gender itself. \n",

But \ntheir symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist \npaganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval's \nterms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century.

Writing \nhas been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and \nwritten cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the \nerosion of that distinction in 'postrnodernist' theories attacking the phallogo-\ncentrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, \nauthoritative, and Singular work, the unique and perfect name.26 Contests \nfor the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political \nstruggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and \nstories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access to \nthe power to signifY; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor \ninnocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a \nonce-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. \nCyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original \ninnocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that \nmarked them as other. \nThe tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and \ndisplace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin \nstories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western \nculture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing \nfor fulfilment in apocalypse. The phallogocentric origin stories most crucial \nfor feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies - technologies that \nwrite the world, biotechnology and microelectronics - that have recently \ntextualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C31. Feminist cyborg \nstories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert \ncommand and control. \nFiguratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women \nof colour; and stories about language have a special power in the rich \ncontemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings of the \nstory of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mestizo 'bastard' \nrace of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry \nspecial meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherne Moraga \n(1983) in Luvillg ill the War Year.< explores the themes of identity when one \nnever possessed the original language, never told the original story, never \nresided in the harmony oflegitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, \nand so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to \nnatural names, mother's or father's.z7 Moraga's writing, her superb literacy, \nis presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche's \nmastery of the conqueror's language - a violation, an illegitimate production, \nthat allows survival. Moraga's language is not 'whole'; it is self-consciously \nspliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror's languages.

Every \nstory that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to \nwholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the \nbirth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation; \nthat is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These \nplots are ruled by a reproductive politics - rebirth without flaw, perfection, \nabstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but \nall agree they have less selfbood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the \noral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another \nroute to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not \npass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It \npasses through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of \nWoman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to \nhave a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on \ncue, no matter how many times a 'Western' commentator remarks on the sad \npassing of another primitive, another organic group done in by 'Western' \ntechnology, by writing.28 These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast \nAsian village women workers in Japanese and US electronics firms described \nby Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and societies. \nSurvival is the stakes in this play of readings. \nTo recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western tradi-\ntions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of \nwomen, people of colour, nature, workers, animals - in short, domination of \nall constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these \ntroubling dualisms are self/other, mindlbody, culture/nature, malelfemale, \ncivilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/ \nmade, active/passive, right/wrong, trutlt!illusion, totallpartial, God/man. \nThe self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of \nthe other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the \nexperience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To \nbe One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to \nbe an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the \nother. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, \ninsubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many. \nHigh-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not \nclear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and \nmachine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve \ninto coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse \n(for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework \neconomy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, \nmosaics, chimeras.

The trance state experienced by many computer users has \nbecome a staple of science-fiction fUm and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraple-\ngics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the \nmost intense experiences of complex hybridization with other communica-\ntion devices.29 Anne McCaffrey's pre-feminist Tlte Sltip Wlto Sang (1969) \nexplored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl's brain and complex \nmachinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child.

For us, in imagination and \nin other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, \nfriendly selves. We don't need organic holism to give impermeable whole-\nness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?).

Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is \nnot largely based on identification. Students facing Joanna Russ for the first \ntime, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce \nor Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The \nAdventures of Alyx or Tlte Female Man, where characters refuse the reader's \nsearch for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, \nexuberant eroticism, and serious politics. Tlte Female Man is the story of four \nversions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not \nmake a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the \ngrowing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R. \nDelany, especially Tales of Neveryon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the \nneolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to \nsubvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction was \nregarded as particularly manly until her 'true' gender was revealed, tells tales \nof reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alternation of \ngenerations of male brood pouches and male nurturing.

Octavia Butler \nwrites of an African sorceress pitting her powers of transfonnation against \nthe genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of time warps that bring a \nmodem US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her \nwhite master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred), \nand of the illegitimate insights into identity and community of an adopted \ncross-species child who came to know the enemy as self (Survivor). In Dawn \n(1987), the first instalment of a series called Xe1togenesis, Butler tells the story \nof Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam's first and repudiated \nwife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of \nNigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child is \ndead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic \nexchange with extra-terrestrial lovers/rescuersldestroyers/genetic en-\ngineers, who reform earth's habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce \nsurviving humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that \ninterrogates reproductive, linguistic, and nuclear politics in a mythic field \nstructured by late twentieth-century race and gender. \nBecause it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIn-\ntyre's Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and \ndangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of \nembodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is 'simply' \nhuman, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, \ncan speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs \nto explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her \nkinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus \nvectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by \nimplants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. \nLaenea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other \nalterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that oflight. Radu \nDracul survives a virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find \nhimself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception \nfor the whole species. All the characters explore the limits of language; the \ndream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, \npartiality, and intimacy even in this world of protean transformation and \nconnection. Superluminal stands also for the defining contradictions of a \ncyborg world in another sense; it embodies textually the intersection of \nfeminist theory and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to \nin this chapter.

We can be \nresponsible for machines; the,y do not dominate or threaten us. We are \nresponsible for boundaries; we are they.

What about men's access to \ndaily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to \nplay? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility \ntaking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory \nof wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but \nthere is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and \ndeconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political \nlanguage to ground one way of looking at science and technology and \nchallenging the informatics of domination - in order to act potently. \nOne last image: organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on \nmetaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. \nI would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are \nsuspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders, \nregeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of \nstructure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning \nor other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The \nregrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been \ninjured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibili-\nties for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a \nmonstrous world without gender. \nCyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, \nthe production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses \nmost of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking \nresponsibility for the social relations of science and technology means \nrefusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so \nmeans embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily \nlife, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. \nIt is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human \nsatisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can \nsuggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our \nbodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common \nlanguage, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a \nfeminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the super-\nsavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, \nidentities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in \nthe spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess. \n",

On the one hand, recent \nsocial studies of science and technology have made available a very strong \nsocial constructionist argument for all forms of knowledge claims, most \ncertainly and especially scientific ones? In these tempting views, no insider's \nperspective is privileged, because all drawings of inside-outside boundaries \nin knowledge are theorized as power moves, not moves towards truth. So, \nfrom the strong social constructionist perspective, why should we be cowed \nby scientists' descriptions of their activity and accomplishments; they and \ntheir patrons have stakes in throwing sand in our eyes. They tell parables \nabout objectivity and scientific method to students in the first years of their \ninitiation, but no practitioner of the high scientific arts would be caught dead \nacting on the textbook versions. Social constructionists make clear that \nofficial ideologies about objectivity and scientific method are particularly bad \nguides to how scientific knowledge is actually //lade. Just as for the rest of us, \nwhat scientists believe or say they do and what they really do have a very \nloose fit. \nThe only people who end up actually believing and, goddess forbid, acting \non the ideological doctrines of disembodied scientific objectivity enshrined \nin elementary textbooks and technoscience booster literature are non-\nscientists, including a few very trusting philosophers. Of course, my \ndesignation of this last group is probably just a reflection of residual \ndisciplinary chauvinism from identifYing with historians of science and too \nmuch time spent with a microscope in early adulthood in a kind of \ndisciplinary pre-oedipal and modernist poetic moment when cells seemed to \nbe cells and organisms, organisms.

But then came the \nlaw of the father and its resolution of the problem of objectivity, solved by \nalways already absent referents, deferred signifieds, split subjects, and the \nendless play of signifiers. Who wouldn't grow up warped? Gender, race, the \nworld itself - all seem just effects of warp speeds in the play of signifiers in a \ncosmic force field. All truths become warp speed effects in a hyper-real \nspace of simulations. But we cannot afford these particular plays on words-\nthe projects of crafting reliable knowledge about the 'natural' world cannot \nbe given over to the genre of paranoid or cynical science fiction. For political \npeople, social constructionism cannot be allowed to decay into the radiant \nemanations of cynicism. \nIn any case, social constructionists could maintain that the ideological \ndoctrine of scientific method and all the philosophical verbiage about \nepistemology were cooked up to distract our attention from getting to know \nthe world effeaive/y by practising the sciences. From this point of view, \nscience - the real game in town, the one we must play - is rhetoric, the \npersuasion of the relevant social actors that one's manufactured knowledge \nis a route to a desired form of very objective power.

All knowledge is a condensed node in an agonistic power \nfield. The strong programme in the sociology of knowledge joins with the \nlovely and nasty tools of semiology and deconstruction to insist on the \nrhetorical nature of truth, including scientific truth. History is a story \nWestern culture buffs tell each other; science is a contestable text and a \npower field; the content is the form.3 Period. The form in science is the \nartefactual-social rhetoric of crafting the world into effective objects. This is \na practice of world-changing persuasions that take the shape of amazing new \nobjects - like microbes, quarks, and genes. \nBut whether or not they have the structure and properties of rhetorical \nobjects, late twentieth-century scientific entities - infective vectors (mi-\ncrobes), elementary particles (quarks), and biomolecular codes (genes) - are \nnot Romantic or moderttist objects with internal laws of coherence!

For example, the force field \nimagery of moves in the fully textualized and coded world is the matrix \nfor many arguments about socially negotiated reality for the postrnodern \nsubject. This world-as-code is, just for starters, a high-tech military field, a \nkind of automated academic battlefield, where blips of light called players \ndisintegrate (what a metaphorl) each other in order to stay in the knowledge \nand power game.

Nancy Hartsock (1983b) got all \nthis crystal clear in her concept of abstract masculinity. \nI, and others, started out wanting a strong tool for deconstructing the truth \nclaims of hostile science by showing the radical historical specificity, and so \ncontestability, of every layer of the onion of scientific and technological \nconstructions, and we end up with a kind of epistemological electro-shock \ntherapy, which far from ushering us into the high stakes tables of the game of \ncontesting public truths, lays us out on the table with self-induced multiple \npersonality disorder. We wanted a way to go beyond showing bias in science \n(that proved too easy anyhow), and beyond separating the good scientific \nsheep from the bad goats of bias and misuse. It seemed promising to do this \nby the strongest possible constructionist argument that left no cracks for \nreducing the issues to bias versus objectivity, use versus misuse, science \nversus pseudo-science. We unmasked the doctrines of objectivity because \nthey threatened our budding sense of collective historical subjectivity and \nagency and our 'embodied' accounts of the truth, and we ended up with one \nmore excuse for not learning any post-Newtonian physics and one more \nreason to drop the old feminist self-help practices of repairing our own cars. \nThey're just texts anyway, so let the boys have them back. Besides these \ntextualized posrmodern worlds are scary, and we prefer our science fiction to \nbe a bit more utopic, maybe like Womall Oil the Edge of Time or even \nWalldergrotmd. \nSome of us tried to stay sane in these disassembled and dissembling times \nby holding out for a feminist version of objectivity. Here, motivated by many \nof the same political desires, is the other seductive end of the duplicitous \nobjectivity problem. Humanistic Marxism was polluted at the source by its \nstructuring ontological theory of the domination of nature in the self-\nconstruction of man and by its closely related impotence to historicize \nanything women did that didn't qualifY for a wage. But Marxism was still a \npromising resource in the form of epistemological feminist mental hygiene \nthat sought our own doctrines of objective vision. Marxist starting points \noffered tools to get to our versions of standpoint theories, insistent \nembodiment, a rich tradition of critiques of hegemony without disempower-\ning positivisms and relativisms, and nuanced theories of mediation. Some \nversions of psychoanalysis aided this approach immensely, especially \nanglophone object relations theory, which maybe did more for US socialist-\nfeminism for a time than anything from the pen of Marx or Engels, much \nless Althusser or any of the late pretenders to sonship treating the subject of \nideology and science.6 \nAnother approach, 'feminist empiricism', also converges with feminist \nuses of Marxian resources to get a theory of science which continues to insist \non legitimate meanings of objectivity and which remains leery of a radical \n",

Feminists have to insist on a better account of the world; it \nis not enough to show radical historical contingency and modes of construc-\ntion for everything. Here, we, as feminists, fmd ourselves perversely \nconjoined with the discourse of many practising scientists, who, when all is \nsaid and done, mostly believe they are describing and discovering things by \nmealls of all their constructing and arguing. Evelyn Keller has been \nparticularly insistent on this fundamental matter, and Harding calls the goal \nof these approaches a 'successor science'. Feminists have stakes in a \nsuccessor science project that offers a more adequate, richer, better account \nof a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our \nown as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of \nprivilege and oppression that make up all positions. In traditional philo-\nsophical categories, the issue is ethics and politics perhaps more than \nepistemology. \nSo, I think my problem and 'our' problem is how to have simultaneously an \naccount of radical historical contingency for all knowledge claims and \nknowing subjects, a critical practice for recognizing our own 'semiotic \ntechnologies' for making meanings, and a no-nonsense commitment to \nfaithful accounts of a 'real' world, one that can be partially shared and \nfriendly to earth-wide projects of finite freedom, adequate material abund-\nance, modest meaning in suffering, and limited happiness. Harding calls this \nnecessary multiple desire a need for a successor science project and a \nposrmodem insistence on irreducible difference and radical multiplicity of \nlocal knowledges. All components of the desire are paradoxical and danger-\nous, and their combination is both contradictory and necessary. Feminists \ndon't need a doctrine of objectivity that promises transcendence, a story that \nloses track of its mediations just where someone might be held responsible \nfor something, and unlimited instrumental power. We don't want a theory of \ninnocent powers to represent the world, where language and bodies both fall \ninto the bliss of organic symbiosis. We also don't want to theorize the world, \nmuch less act within it, in terms of Global Systems, but we do need an \nearth-wide network of connections, including the ability partially to translate \nknowledges among very different - and power-differentiated - communities. \nWe need the power of modem critical theories of how meanings and bodies \nget made, not in order to deny meaning and bodies, but in order to live in \nmeanings and bodies that have a chance for a future. \nNatural, social, and human sciences have always been implicated in hopes \nlike these. Science has been about a search for translation, convertibility, \nmobility of meanings, and universality - which I call reductionism, when one \nlanguage (guess whose) must be enforced as the standard for all the \ntranslations and conversions.

That is the deadly fantasy that \nfeminists and others have identified in some versions of objectivity doctrines \nin the service of hierarchical and positivist orderings of what can count as \nknowledge. That is one of the reasons the debates about objectivity matter, \nmetaphorically and otherwise. Immortality and omnipotence are not our \ngoals. But we could use some enforceable, reliable accounts of things not \nreducible to power moves and agonistic, high status games of rhetoric or to \nscientistic, positivist arrogance. This point applies whether we are talking \nabout genes, social classes, elementary particles, genders, races, or texts; the \npoint applies to the exact, natural, social, and human sciences, despite the \nslippery ambiguities of the words objectivity and science as we slide around the \ndiscursive terrain. In our efforts to climb the greased pole leading to a usable \ndoctrine of objectivity, I and most other feminists in the objectivity debates \nhave alternatively, or even simultaneously, held on to both ends of the \ndichotomy, which Harding describes in terms of successor science projects \nversus postmodernist accounts of difference and I have sketched in this \nchapter as radical constructivism versus feminist critical empiricism.

We need to learn in our bodies, \nendowed with primate colour and stereoscopic vision, how to attach the \nobjective to our theoretical and political scanners in order to name where we \nare and are not, in dimensions of mental and physical space we hardly know \nhow to name. So, not so perversely, objectivity turns out to be about \nparticular and specific embodiment, and defmitely not about the false vision \npromising transcendence of all limits and responsibility. The moral is \nsimple: only partial perspective promises objective vision. This is an \nobjective vision that initiates, rather than closes off, the problem of \nresponsibility for the generativity of all visual practices. Partial perspective \ncan be held accountable for both its promising and its destructive monsters. \nAll Western cultural narratives about objectivity are allegories of the \nideologies of the relations of what we call mind and body, of distance and \nresponsibility, embedded in the science question in feminism.

There is no unmediated \nphotograph or passive camera obscura in scientific accounts of bodies and \nmachines; there are only highly specific visual possibilities, each with a \nwonderfully detailed, active, partial way of organizing worlds. All these \npictures of the world should not be allegories of infinite mobility and \ninterchangeability, but of elaborate specificity and difference and the loving \ncare people might take to learn how to see faithfully from another's point of \nview, even when the other is our own machine. That's not alienating \ndistance; that's a possible allegory for feminist versions of objectivity. \nUnderstanding how these visual systems work, technically, socially, and \npsychically ought to be a way of embodying feminist objectivity. \nMany currents in feminism attempt to theorize grounds for trusting \nespecially the vantage points of the subjugated; there is good reason to \nbelieve vision is better from below the brilliant space platforms of the \n",

Irresponsible means unable to be called \ninto account. There is a premium on establishing the capacity to see from the \nperipheries and the depths. But here lies a serious danger of romaticizing \nand! or appropriating the vision of the less powerful while claiming to see \nfrom their positions.

The positionings of the subjugated are not \nexempt from critical re-examination, decoding, deconstruction, and inter-\npretation; that is, from both semiological and hermeneutic modes of critical \nenquiry. The standpoints of the subjugated are not 'innocent' positions. On \nthe contrary, they are preferred because in principle they are least likely to \nallow denial of the critical and interpretative core of all knowledge. They are \nsavvy to modes of denial through repression, forgetting, and disappearing \nacts - ways of being nowhere while claiming to see comprehensively. The \nsubjugated have a decent chance to be on to the god-trick and all its dazzling \n- and, therefore, blinding - illuminations. 'Subjugated' standpoints are \npreferred because they seem to promise more adequate, sustained, objective, \ntransforming accounts of the world. But how to see from below is a problem \nrequiring at least as much skill with bodies and language, with the \nmediations of vision, as the 'highest' techno-scientific visualizations. \nSuch preferred positioning is as hostile to various forms of relativism as to \nthe most explicidy totalizing versions of claims to scientific authority. But the \nalternative to relativism is not totalization and single vision, which is always \nfmally the unmarked category whose power depends on systematic narrow-\ning and obscuring. The alternative to relativism is partial, locatable, critical \nknowledges sustaining the possibility of webs of connections called solidarity \nin politics and shared conversations in epistemology. Relativism is a way of \nbeing nowhere while claiming to be everywhere equally. The 'equality' of \npositioning is a denial of responsibility and critical enquiry. Relativism is the \nperfect mirror twin of totalization in the ideologies of objectivity; both deny \nthe stakes in location, embodiment, and partial perspective; both make it \nimpossible to see well. Relativism and totalization are both 'god-tricks' \npromising vision from everywhere and nowhere equally and fully, common \nmyths in rhetorics surrounding Science. But it is precisely in the politics and \nepistemology of partial perspectives that the possibility of sustained, rational, \nobjective enquiry rests. \nSo, with many other feminists, I want to argue for a doctrine and practice \nof objectivity that privileges contestation, deconstruction, passionate con-\nstruction, webbed connections, and hope for transformation of systems of \n",

'Passionate detachment' (Kuhn, 1982) requires more than \nacknowledged and self-critical partiality. We are also bound to seek \nperspective from those points of view, which can never be known in advance \nwhich promise something quite extraordinary, that is, knowledge potent fo; \nconstructing worlds less organized by axes of domination. In such a \nviewpoint, the unmarked category would really disappear _ quite a difference \nfrom simply repeating a disappearing act. The imaginary and the rational-\nthe visionary and objective vision - hover close together. I think Harding's \nplea for a succeSSor science and for postmodern sensibilities must be read to \nargue that this close touch of the fantastic element of hope for transfonnative \nkno~l:dge and the severe check and stimulus of sustained critical enquiry \nare Jomtly the ground of any believable claim to objectivity or rationality not \nriddled with breath-taking denials and repressions. It is even possible to read \nthe record of scientific revolutions in terms of this feminist doctrine of \nrationality and objectivity. Science has been utopian and visionary from the \nstart; that is one reason 'we' need it. \nA commitment to mobile positioning and to passionate detachment is \ndependent on the impossibility of innocent 'identity' politics and epistemolo-\ngies as strategies for seeing from the standpoints of the subjugated in order \nto see well. One cannot 'be' either a cell or molecule _ or a woman \ncolonized person, labourer, and so on - if one intends to see and see fro~ \nthese positions critically. 'Being' is much more problematic and contingent. \nAlso, one cannot relocate in any possible vantage point without being \naccountable for that movement. Vision is always a question of the power to \nsee - and perhaps of the violence implicit in our visualizing practices. With \nwhose blood were my eyes crafted? These points also apply to testimony \nfrom the position of 'oneself'. We are not immediately present to ourselves. \nSelf-knowledge requires a semiotic-material technology linking meanings \nand bodies. Self-identity is a bad visual system. Fusion is a bad strategy of \npositioning. The boys in the human sciences have called this doubt about \nself-presence the 'death of the subject', that single ordering point of will and \nconsciousness. That judgement seems bizarre to me. I prefer to call this \ngenerative doubt the opening of non-isomorphic subjects, agents, and \nterritories of stories unimaginable from the vantage point of the cyclopian, \nself-satiated eye of the master subject. The Western eye has fundamentally \nbeen a wandering eye, a travelling lens. These peregrinations have often \nbeen violent and insistent on mirrors for a conquering self - but not always. \nWestern feminists also inherit some skill in learning to participate in \nrevisualizing worlds turned upside down in earth-transforming challenges to \nthe views of the masters.

'Splitting' in this context should be about heterogeneous \nmultiplicities that are simultaneously necessary and incapable of being \nsquashed into isomorphic slots or cumulative lists. This geometry pertains \nwithin and among subjects. The topography of subjectivity is multi-\ndimensional; so, therefore, is vision. The knowing self is partial in all its \nguises, never fmished, whole, simply there and original; it is always \nconstructed and stitched together imperfectly, and tlzerefore able to join with \nanother, to see together without claiming to be another. Here is the promise \nof objectivity: a scientific knower seeks the subject position not of identity, \nbut of objectivity; that is, partial connection. There is no way to 'be' \nsimultaneously in all, or wholly in any, of the privileged (subjugated) \npositions structured by gender, race, nation, and class. And that is a short list \nof critical positions. The search for such a 'full' and total position is the \nsearch for the fetishized perfect subject of oppositional history, sometimes \nappearing in feminist theory as the essentialized Third World Woman \n(Mohanty, 1984). Subjugation is not grounds for an ontology; it might be a \nvisual clue. Vision requires instruments of vision; an optics is a politics of \npositioning. Instruments of vision mediate standpoints; there is no immedi-\nate vision from the standpoints of the subjugated. Identity, including \nself-identity, does not produce science; critical positioning does, that is, \nobjectivity. Only those occupying the positions of the dominators are \nself-identical, unmarked, disembodied, unmediated, transcendent, born \nagain. It is unfortunately possible for the subjugated to lust for and even \nscramble into that subject position -\nand then disappear from view. \nKnowledge from the point of view of the unmarked is truly fantastic, \ndistorted, and so irrational. The only position from which objectivity could \nnot possibly be practised and honoured is the standpoint of the master, the \nMan, the One God, whose Eye produces, appropriates, and orders all \ndifference. No one ever accused the God of monotheism of objectivity, only \nof indifference.

Gender is a field of structured and structuring difference, where \nthe tones of ememe localization, of the intimately personal and individual-\nized body, vibrate in the same field with global high tension emissions. \nFeminist embodiment, then, is not about fixed location in a reified body, \nfemale or otherwise, but about nodes in fields, inflections in orientations, \nand responsibility for difference in material-semiotic fields of meaning. \nEmbodiment is significant prosthesis; objectivity cannot be about fixed vision \nwhen what counts as an object is precisely what world history turns out to be \nabout. \nHow should one be positioned in order to see in this situation of tensions, \nresonances, transformations, resistances, and complicities? Here, primate \nvision is not immediately a very powerful metaphor or technology for \nfeminist political-epistemological clarification, since it seems to present to \nconsciousness already processed and objectified fields; things seem already \nfixed and distanced. But the visual metaphor allows one to go beyond fixed \nappearances, which are only the end products. The metaphor invites us to \ninvestigate the varied apparatuses of visual production, including the \nprosthetic technologies interfaced with our biological eyes and brains. And \nhere we find highly particular machineries for processing regions of the \nelectro-magnetic spectrum into our pictures of the world. It is in the \nintricacies of these visualization technologies in which we are embedded that \nwe will find metaphors and means for understanding and intervening in the \npatterns of objectification in the world, that is, the patterns of reality for \nwhich we must be accountable. In these metaphors, we find means for \nappreciating simultaneously both the concrete, 'real' aspect and the aspect of \nsemiosis and production in what we call scientific knowledge. \nI am arguing for politics and epistemologies of location, positioning, and \nsituating, where partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard \nto make rational knowledge claims. These are claims on people's lives; the \nview from a body, always a complex, contradictory, structuring and struc-\ntured body, versus the view from above, from nowhere, from simplicity.

Here is a criterion for deciding the science \nquestion in militarism, that dream science/technology of perfect language, \nperfect communication, final order. \nFeminism loves another science: the sciences and politics of interpreta-\ntion, translation, stuttering, and the partly understood. Feminism is about \nthe sciences of the multiple subject with (at least) double vision. Feminism is \nabout a critical vision consequent upon a critical positioning in in-\nhomogeneous gendered social space.1O Translation is always interpretative, \ncritical, and partial.

So location is \nabout vulnerability; location resists the politics of closure, finality, or, to \nborrow from Althusser, feminist objectivity resists 'simplification in the last \ninstance'. That is because feminist embodiment resists fixation and is \ninsatiably curious about the webs of differential positioning. There is no \nsingle feminist standpoint because our maps require too many dimensions \nfor that metaphor to ground our visions. But the feminist standpoint \ntheorists' goal of an epistemology and politics of engaged, accountable \npositioning remains eminently potent. The goal is better accounts of the \nworld, that is, 'science'. \nAbove all, rational knowledge does not pretend to disengagement: to be \nfrom everywhere and so nowhere, to be free from interpretation, from being \nrepresented, to be fully self-contained or fully formalizable. Rational \nknowledge is a process of ongoing critical interpretation among 'fields' of \ninterpreters and decoders. Rational knowledge is power-sensitive conversa-\ntion (King, 1987a): \nknowledge:community::knowledge:power \nhermeneutics:semiology::critical interpretation:codes. \nDecoding and transcoding plus translation and criticism; all are necessary. \nSo science becomes the paradigmatic model not of closure, but of that which \nis contestable and contested. Science becomes the myth not of what escapes \nhuman agency and responsibility in a realm above the fray, but rather of \naccountability and responsibility for translations and solidarities linking the \ncacophonous visions and visionary voices that characterize the knowledges of \nthe subjugated. A splitting of senses, a confusion of voice and sight, rather \nthan clear and distinct ideas, becomes the metaphor for the ground of the \nrational. We seek not the knowledges ruled by phallogocentrism (nostalgia \nfor the presence of the one true Word) and disembodied vision, but those \nruled by partial sight and limited voice. We do not seek partiality for its own \nsake, but for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings situated \nknowledges make possible. The only way to find a larger vision is to be \nsomewhere in particular. The science question in feminism is about \nobjectivity as positioned rationality. Its images are not the products of escape \nand transcendence of limits, i.e., the view from above, but the joining of \npartial views and halting voices into a collective subject position that \npromises a vision of the means of ongoing finite embodiment, ofliving within \nlimits and contradictions, i.e., of views from somewhere. \n",

Through the insistent ambiguity, I have fore-\ngrounded a field of commonalities binding exact, physical, natural, social, \npolitical, biological, and human sciences; and I have tied this whole \nheterogeneous field of academically (and industrially, for example, in \npublishing, the weapons trade, and pharmaceuticals) institutionalized know-\nledge production to a meaning of science that insists on its potency in \nideological struggles. But, partly in order to give play to both the specificities \nand the highly permeable boundaries of meanings in discourse on science, I \nwould like to suggest a resolution to one ambiguity. Throughout the field of \nmeanings constituting science, one of the commonalities concerns the status \nof any object of knowledge and of related claims about the faithfulness of our \naccounts to a 'real world', no matter how mediated for us and no matter how \ncomplex and contradictory these worlds may be. Feminists, and others who \nhave been most active as critics of the sciences and their claims or associated \nideologies, have shied away from doctrines of scientific objectivity in part \nbecause of the suspicion that an 'object' of knowledge is a passive and inert \nthing. Accounts of such objects can seem to be either appropriations of a \nfIxed and determined world reduced to resource for the instrumentalist \nprojects of destructive Western societies, or they can be seen as masks for \ninterests, usually dominating interests. \nFor example, 'sex' as an object of biological knowledge appears regularly \nin the guise of biological determinism, threatening the fragile space for social \nconstructionism and critical theory, with their attendant possibilities for \nactive and transformative intervention, called into being by feminist concepts \nof gender as socially, historically, and semiotically positioned difference. And \nyet, to lose authoritative biological accounts of sex, which set up productive \ntensions with its binary pair, gender, seems to be to lose too much; it seems \nto be to lose not just analytic power within a particular Western tradition, but \nthe body itself as anything but a blank page for social inscriptions, including \nthose of biological discourse. The same problem of loss attends a radical \n'reduction' of the objects of physics or of any other sciences to the ephemera \nof discursive production and social construction. I I \nBut the difficulty and loss are not necessary. They derive partly from the \nanalytical tradition, deeply indebted to Aristotle and to the transformative \nhistory of 'White Capitalist Patriarchy' (how may we name this scandalous \nThing?) that turns everything into a resource for appropriation, in which an \nobject of knowledge is fmally itself only matter for the seminal power, the \nact, of the knower.

It - the world - must, in short, be objectified as thing, \nnot as an agent; it must be matter for the self-formation of the only social \nbeing in the productions of knowledge, the human knower. Zoe SofouUs \n(1988) identified the structure of this mode of knowing in technoscience as \n'resourcing' - the second-birthing of Man through the homogenizing of all \nthe world's body into resource for his perverse projects. Nature is only the \nraw material of culture, appropriated, preserved, enslaved, exalted, or \notherwise made flexible for disposal by culture in the logic of capitalist \ncolonialism. Similarly, sex is only the matter to the act of gender; the \nproductionist logic seems inescapable in traditions of Western binarisms. \nThis analytical and historical narrative logic accounts for my nervousness \nabout the sex/gender distinction in the recent history of feminist theory. Sex \nis 'resourced' for its re-presentation as gender, which 'we' can control. It has \nseemed all but impossible to avoid the trap of an appropriationist logic of \ndomination built into the nature/culture binarism and its generative lineage, \nincluding the sex/gender distinction. \nIt seems clear that feminist accounts of objectivity and embodiment - that \nis, of a world - of the kind sketched in this chapter require a deceptively \nsimple manoeuvre within inherited Western analytical traditions, a man-\noeuvre begun in dialectics, but stopping short of the needed revisions. \nSituated knowledges require that the object of knowledge be pictured as an \nactor and agent, not a screen or a ground or a resource, never finally as slave \nto the master that closes off the dialectic in his unique agency and authorship \nof 'objective' knowledge. The point is paradigmatically clear in critical \napproaches to the social and human sciences, where the agency of people \nstudied itself transforms the entire project of producing social theory. \nIndeed, coming to terms with the agency of the 'objects' studied is the only \nway to avoid gross error and false knowledge of many kinds in these sciences. \nBut the same point must apply to the other knowledge projects called \nsciences. A corollary of the insistence that ethics and politics covertly or \novertly provide the bases for objectivity in the sciences as a heterogeneous \nwhole, and not just in the social sciences, is granting the status of agentiactor \nto the 'objects' of the world. Actors come in many and wonderful forms. \nAccounts of a 'real' world do not, then, depend on a logic of 'discovery', but \non a power-charged social relation of 'conversation'. The world neither \nspeaks itself nor disappears in favour of a master decoder. The codes of the \nworld are not still, waiting only to be read. The world is not raw material for \nhumanization; the thorough attacks on humanism, another branch of 'death \nof the subject' discourse, have made this point quite clear. In some critical \nsense that is crudely hinted at by the clumsy category of the social or of \nagency, the world encountered in knowledge projects is an active entity. In so \n",

The approach I am recommending is not a \nversion of 'realism', which has proved a rather poor way of engaging with the \nworld's active agency. \nMy simple, perhaps simple-minded, manoeuvre is obviously not new in \nWestern philosophy, but it has a special feminist edge to it in relation to the \nscience question in feminism and to the linked questions of gender as \nsituated difference and of female embodiment. Ecofeminists have perhaps \nbeen most insistent on some version of the world as active subject, not as \nresource to be mapped and appropriated in bourgeois, Marxist, or masculin-\nist projects. Acknowledging the agency of the world in knowledge makes \nroom for some unsettling possibilities, including a sense of the world's \nindependent sense of humour. Such a sense of humour is not comfortable \nfor humanists and others committed to the world as resource. Richly \nevocative figures exist for feminist visualizations of the world as witty agent. \nWe need not lapse into an appeal to a primal mother resisting becoming \nresource. The Coyote or Trickster, embodied in American Southwest \nIndian accounts, suggests our situation when we give up mastery but keep \nsearching for fidelity, knowing all the while we will be hoodwinked.

I like to see feminist \ntheory as a reinvented coyote discourse obligated to its enabling sources in \nmany kinds of heterogeneous accounts of the world. \nAnother rich feminist practice in science in the last couple of decades \nillustrates particularly well the 'activation' of the previously passive categor-\nies of objects of knowledge. The activation permanently problematizes \nbinary distinctions like sex and gender, without however eliminating their \nstrategic utility. I refer to the reconstructions in primatology, especially but \nnot only women's practice as primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and \nbehavioural ecologists, of what may count as sex, especially as female sex, in \nscientific accounts (Haraway, 1989b). The body, the object of biological \ndiscourse, itself becomes a most engaging being. Claims of biological \ndeterminism can never be the same again.

The relations between sex and gender have to be categorically \nreworked within these frames of knowledge. I would like to suggest this \ntrend in explanatory strategies in biology as an allegory for interventions \nfaithful to projects of feminist objectivity. The point is not that these nelV \npictures of the biological female are simply true or not open to contestation \nand conversation. Quite the opposite. But these pictures foreground know-\nledge as situated conversation at every level of its articulation. The boundary \nbetween animal and human is one of the stakes in this allegory, as well as that \nbetween machine and organism. \nSo I will close with a fmal category useful to a feminist theory of situated \nknowledges: the apparatus of bodily production. In her analysis of the \nproduction of the poem as an object of literary value, Katie King offers tools \nthat clarifY matters in the objectivity debates among feminists. King suggests \nthe term 'apparatus of literary production' to highlight the emergence of \nwhat is embodied as literature at the intersection of art, business, and \ntechnology. The apparatus of literary production is a matrix from which \n'literature' is born. Focusing on the potent object of value called the 'poem', \nKing applies her analytic frame to the relation of women and writing \ntechnologies (King, 1987b). I would like to adapt her work to understanding \nthe generation - the actual production and reproduction - of bodies and \nother objects of value in scientific knowledge projects. At first glance, there \nis a limitation to using King's scheme inherent in the 'facticity' of biological \ndiscourse that is absent from literary discourse and its knowledge claims. Are \nbiological bodies 'produced' or 'generated' in the same strong senSe as \npoems? From the early stirrings of Romanticism in the late eighteenth \ncentury, many poets and biologists have believed that poetry and orgsnisms \nare siblings.

I wish to translate the ideological dimensions of \n'facticity' and 'the organic' into a cumbersome entity called a 'material-\nsemiotic actor'. This unwieldy term is intended to highlight the object of \nknowledge as an active, meaning-generating axis of the apparatus of bodily \nproduction, without ever implying inImediate presence of such objects or, \nwhat is the same thing, their final or unique detennination of what can count \nas objective knowledge at a particular historical juncture.

The power of biomedicine and biotechnolo-\ngy is constantly re-produced, or it would cease. This power is not a thing \nfIxed and permanent, embedded in plastic and ready to section for \nmicroscopic observation by the historian or critic. The cultural and material \nauthority of biomedicine's productions of bodies and selves is more \nvulnerable, more dynamic, more elusive, and more powerful than that. \nBut if there has been recognition of the many non-, para-, anti-, or \nextra-scientifIc languages in company with biomedicine that structure the \nembodied semiosis of mortality in the industrialized world, it is much less \ncommon to fInd emphasis on the multiple languages within the territory that \nis often so glibly marked scientifIc. 'Science says' is represented as a univocal \nlanguage. Yet even the spliced character of the potent words in 'science' \nhints at a barely contained and inharmonious heterogeneity. The words for \nthe overlapping discourses and their objects of knowledge, and for the \nabstract corporate names for the concrete places where the discourse-\nbuilding work is done, suggest both the blunt foreshortening of technicist \napproaches to communication and the uncontainable pressures and confu-\nsions at the boundaries of meanings within 'science' - biotechnology, \nbiomedicine, psychoneuroimmunology, immunogenetics, immunoendo-\ncrinology, neuroendocrinology, monoclonal antibodies, hybridomas, inter-\nleukines, Genentech, Embrex, Immunetech, Biogen. \nThis chapter explores some of the contending popular and technical \nlanguages constructing biomedical, biotechnical bodies and selves in post-\nmodern scientifIc culture in the United States in the 1980s. Scientific \ndiscourses are 'lumpy'; they contain and enact condensed contestations for \nmeanings and practices. The chief object of my attention will be the potent \nand polymorphous object of belief, knowledge, arid practice called the \nimmune system. My thesis is that the immune system is an elaborate icon for \nprincipal systems of symbolic and material 'difference' in late capitalism. \nPre-eminently a twentieth-century object, the immune system is a map \ndrawn to guide recognition and misrecognition of self and other in the \ndialectics of Western biopolitics. That is, the immune system is a plan for \nmeaningful action to construct and maintain the boundaries for what may \ncount as self and other in the crucial realms of the normal and the \npathological.

This mundane point \nwas fortuitously captured in the title listings in the 1986-87 Books in Print, \nwhere I was searching for a particular undergraduate textbook on immuno-\nlogy. The several pages of encries beginning with the prefIX 'immuno-' were \nbounded, according to the English rules of alphabetical listing, by a volume \ncalled Immortals oJ Science Piaion, near one end, and by T7\" Immutability oJ \nGod, at the other. Examining the last section of the textbook to which Books \nin Print led me, Immunology: A Synthesis (Golub, '987), I found what I was \nlooking for: a historical progression of diagrams of theories ofimmunological \nregulation and an obituary for their draftsman, an important immunologist, \nRichard K. Gershon, who 'discovered' the suppressor T cell. The standard \nobituary tropes for the scientist, who 'must have had what the earliest \nexplorers had, an insatiable desire to be the first person to see something, to \nknow that you are where no man has been before', set the tone. The \nhero-scientist 'gloried in the layer upon interconnected layer of [the immune \nresponse's] complexity. He thrilled at seeing a layer of that complexity which \nno one had seen before' (Golub, 1987, pp. 531-2). It is reasonable to \nsuppose that all the likely readers of this textbook have been reared within \nhearing range of the ringing tones of the introduction to the voyages of the \nfederation starship Enterprise in Star Trek - to boldly go where no man has \ngone before. Science remains an important genre of Western exploration \nand travel literature. Similarly, no reader, no matter how literal-minded, \ncould be innocent of the gendered erotic trope that fIgures the hero's \nprobing into nature's laminated secrets, glorying simultaneously in the \nlayered complexity and in his own techno-erotic touch that goes ever deeper. \nScience as heroic quest and as erotic technique applied to the body of nature \nare utterly conventional fIgures. They take on a particular edge in late \ntwentieth-century immune system discourse, where themes of nuclear \nextenninism, space adventure, extra-terrestrialism, exotic invaders, and \nmilitary high-technology are pervasive. \nBut Golub's and Gershon's intended and explicit text is not about space \ninvaders and the immune system as a Star Wars prototype. Their theme is \nthe love of complexity and the intimate natural bodily technologies for \ngenerating the harmonies of organic life. In four illustrations - dated 1968, \n'974, '977, and 1982 - Gershon sketched his conception of 'the immuno-\nlogical orchestra' (Golub, 1987, pp. 533-6). This orchestra is a wonderful \n",

From his \ncommanding position in the root of a lymph node, the G.O.D. of the fIrst \nillustration conducts the orchestra ofT and B cells and macrophages as they \nmarch about the body and play their specifIc parts (plate 3). The lympho-\ncytes all look like Casper the ghost with the appropriate distinguishing \nnuclear morphologies drawn in the centre of their shapeless bodies.

These three were called the Blessed Trinity of the \nsecularized sacred body, and histories of the great adventures of molecular \nbiology could be titled The Eighth Day of Creation Gudson, 1979), an image \nthat takes on a certain irony in the venture capital and political environments \nof current biotechnology companies, like Genentech. In the technical-\nmythic systems of molecular biology, code rules embodied structure and \nfunction, never the reverse. Genesis is a serious joke, when the body is \ntheorized as a coded text whose secrets yield only to the proper reading \nconventions, and when the laboratory seems best characterized as a vast \nassemblage of technological and organic inscription devices. The Central \nDogma was about a master control system for infonnation flow in the codes \nthat determine meaning in the great technological communication systems \nthat organisms progressively have become after the Second World War. The \nbody is an artifIcial intelligence system, and the relation of copy and original \nis reversed and then exploded. \nG.O.D. is the Generator of Diversity, the source of the awe-inspiring \nmultiple specifIcities of the polymorphous system of recognition and mis-\nrecognition we call the inunune system. By the second illustration (1974), \nG.O.D. is no longer in front of the immune orchestra, but is standing, arms \nfolded, looking authoritative but not very busy, at the top of the lymph node, \nsurrounded by the musical lymphocytes (plate 4). A special cell, the T \nsuppressor cell, has taken over the role of conductor. By 1977, the \nillustration (plate 5) no longer has a single conductor, but is 'led' by three \nmysterious subsets of T cells, who hold a total of twelve batons signitying \ntheir direction-giving surface identity markers; and G.O.D. scratches his \nhead in patent confusion. But the immune band plays on. In the fmal \nillustration, from 1982, (Plate 6) 'the generator of diversity seems resigned to \nthe conflicting calls of the angels of help and suppression', who perch above \nhis left and right shoulders (Golub, 1987, p. 536).

The joke of single masterly control of \norganismic harmony in the symphonic system responsible for the integrity of \n'self' has become a kind of postmodern pastiche of multiple centres and \nperipheries, where the immune music that the page suggests would surely \nsound like nursery school space music. All the actors that used to be on the \nstage-set for the unambiguous and coherent biopolitical subject are still \npresent, but their harmonies are definitely a bit problematic. \nBy the 1980s, the inunune system is unambiguously a postmodern object \n- symbolically, technically, and politically. Katherine Hayles (1987b) char-\nacterizes postmodernism in terms of'three waves of developments occurring \nat multiple sites within the culture, including literature and science'. Her \narchaeology begins with Saussurean linguistics, through which symbol \nsystems were 'denaturalized'. Internally generated relational difference, \nrather than mimesis, ruled signification. Hayles sees the culmination of this \napproach in Claude Shannon's mid-century statistical theory ofinformation, \ndeveloped for packing the largest number of signals on a transmission line \nfor the Bell Telephone Company and extended to cover communication acts \nin general, including those directed by the codes of bodily semiosis in \nethology or molecular biology. 'Information' generating and processing \nsystems, therefore, are postmodern objects, embedded in a theory of \ninternally differentiated signifiers and remote from doctrines of representa-\ntion as mimesis. A history-changing artefact, 'information' exists only in very \nspecific kinds of universes.3 Progressively, the world and the sign seemed to \nexist in incommensurable universes - there was literally no measure linking \nthem, and the reading conventions for all texts came to resemble those \nrequired for science fiction. What emerged was a global technology that \n'made the separation of text from context an everyday experience'. Hayles's \nsecond wave, 'energized by the rapid development of information techno-\nlogy, made the disappearance of stable, reproducible context an international \nphenomenon ... Context was no longer a natural part of every experience, \nbut an artifact that could be altered at will.' Hayles's third wave of \ndenaturalization concerned time. 'Beginning with the Special Theory of \nRelativity, time increasingly came to be seen not as an inevitable progression \nalong a linear scale to which all humans were subject, but as a construct that \ncould be conceived in different ways.' \nLanguage is no longer an echo of the verbum dei, but a technical construct \nworking on principles of internally generated difference. If the early modem \nnatural philosopher or Renaissance physician conducted an exegesis of the \ntext of nature written in the language of geometry or of cosmic correspond-\nences, the postmodern scientist still reads for a living, but has as a text the \ncoded systems of recognition - prone to the pathologies of mis-recognition -\nembodied in objects like computer networks and immune systems.

The 'construct' is at the centre of attention; \nmaking, reading, writing, and meaning seem to be very close to the same \nthing. This near-identity between technology, body, and semiosis suggests a \nparticular edge to the mutually constitutive relations of political economy, \nsymbol, and science that 'inform' contemporary research trends in medical \nanthropology. \nTHE APPARATUS OF BODILY PRODUCTION: \nTHE TECHNO-BIOPOLITICS OF ENGAGEMENT \nBodies, then, are not born; they are made (Plate 7). Bodies have been as \nthoroughly denaturalized as sign, context, and time. Late twentieth-century \nbodies do not grow from internal harmortic principles theorized within \nRomanticism. Neither are they discovered in the domains of realism and \nmoderrtism. One is not born a woman, Simone de Beauvoir correcuy \ninsisted. It took the political-epistemological terrain of postmodernism to be \nable to insist on a co-text to de Beauvoir's: one is not born an organism. \nOrganisms are made; they are constructs of a world-changing kind. The \nconstructions of an organism's boundaries, the job of the discourses of \nimmunology, are particularly potent mediators of the experiences of sickness \nand death for industrial and post-industrial people. \nIn this over-determined context, I will ironically - and inescapably -\ninvoke a constructionist concept as an analytic device to pursue an under-\nstanding of what kinds of units, selves, and individuals inhabit the universe \nstructured by immune system discourse: This conceptual tool, 'the appar-\natus of bodily production', was discussed earlier on pp. '97-20' (King, \n1987b). Scientific bodies are not ideological constructions. Always radically \nhistorically specific, bodies have a different kind of specificity and effectivity, \nand so they invite a different kind of engagement and intervention. The \nnotion of a 'material-semiotic actor' is intended to highlight the object of \nknowledge as an active part of the apparatus of bodily production, without \never implying immediate presence of such objects or, what is the same thing, \ntheir final or unique determination of what can count as objective knowledge \nof a biomedical body at a particular historical juncture. Bodies as objects of \nknowledge are material-semiotic generative nodes. Their boundaries \nmaterialize in social interaction; 'objects' like bodies do not pre-exist as \nsuch. Scientific objectivity (the siting/sighting of objects) is not about \ndis-engaged discovery, but about mutual and usually unequal structuring, \nabout taking risks.

In the beginning was the copy. \nThe Human Genome Project might define postmodem species being \n(pace the philosophers), but what of individual being? Richard Dawkins \nraised this knotty problem in The Extended Phenotype. He noted that in Ig12, \nJulian Huxley defined individuality in biological terms as 'literally indivisibil-\nity - the quality of being sufficiently heterogeneous in form to be rendered \nnon-functional if cut in half' (Dawkins, Ig82, p. 250). That seems a \npromising start. In Huxley's terms, surely you or I would count as an \nindividual, while many worms would not. The individuality of worms was not \nachieved even at the height of bourgeois liberalism, so no cause to worry \nthere. But Huxley's definition does not answer which /unaiml is at issue. \nNothing answers that in the abstrac:; ;, depends on what is to be done.' You \nor I (whatever problematic address these pronouns have) might be an \nindividual for some purposes, but not for others. This is a normal ontological \nstate for cyborgs and women, if not for Aristotelians and men. Function is \nabout action. Here is where Dawkins has a radical solution, as he proposes a \nview of individuality that is strategic at every level of meaning. There arc \nmany kinds of individuals for Dawkins, but one kind has primacy. 'The \nwhole purpose of our search for a \"unit of selection\" is to discover a suitable \nactor to play the leading role in our metaphors of purpose' (lg82, p. gl). The \n'metaphors of purpose' come down to a single bottom line: replication. 'A \nsuccessful replicator is one that succeeds in lasting, in the form of copies, for \na very long time measured in generations, and succeeds in propogating many \ncopies of itself' (lg82, pp. 87-8). \nThe replica tor fragment whose individuality finally matters most, in the \nconstructed time of evolutionary theory, is not particularly 'unitary'. For all \nthat it serves, for Dawkins, as the 'unit' of natural selection, the replicator's \nboundaries are not frxed and its inner reaches remain mutable. But still, \nthese units must be a bit smaller than a 'single' gene coding for a protein. \nUnits are only good enough to sustain the technology of copying. Like the \nreplicons' borders, the boundaries of other strategic assemblages are not \nfrxed either - it all has to do with the broad net cast by strategies of \nreplication in a world where self and other are very much at stake. \nThe integrated multi-cellular organism is a phenomenon which has \nemerged as a result of natural selection on primitively selfrsh replicators. \nIt has paid replicators to behave gregariously [50 much for 'harmony', in \nthe short run]. The phenotypic power by which they ensure their survival \nis in principle extended and unbounded. In practice the organism has \narisen as a partially bounded local concentration, a shared knot of \nreplicator power.

There are two major cell lineages to the system. The \nfirst is the lymphocytes, which include the several types of T cells (helper, \nsuppressor, killer, and variations of all these) and the B cells (each type of \nwhich can produce only one sort of the vast array of potential circulating \nantibodies).

The concatenation of \ninternal recognitions and responses would go on indefinitely, in a series of \ninterior mirrorings of sites on immunoglobulin molecules, such that the \nimmune system would always be in a state of dynamic internal responding.

Both Jerne's and Winograd's \nformulations resist the means of conceptualization facilitated most readily by \na rationalist theory of recognition or representation.

He ignores the mythic, but it pervades \nhis texts. 'Organism' and 'individual' have not disappeared; rather, they have \nbeen fully denaturalized. That is, they are ontologically contingent con-\nstructs from the point of view of the biologist, not just in the loose ravings of \na cultural critic or feminist historian of science. \nLeo Buss reinterpreted two important remaining processes or objects that \nhad continued to resist such denaturing: (I) embryonic development, the \nvery process of the construction of an individual; and (2) immune system \ninteractions, the iconic means for maintaining the integrity of the one in the \nface of the many. His basic argument for the immune system is that it is \nmade up of several variant cell lineages, each engaged in its own replicative \n'ends'. The contending cell lineages serve somatic function because \nthe receptors that ensure delivery of growth-enhancing mitogens also \ncompel somatic function. The cytotoxic T-cell recognizes its target with \nthe same receptor arrangement used by the macrophage to activate that \ncell lineage.

This is a large enquiry, and in \nthe paragraphs that follow I only begin to sketch a few of the sometimes \npromising but more often profoundly disturbing recent cultural productions \nof the postmodern immune system-mediated body.1O At this stage, the \nanalysis can only serve to sharpen, not to answer, the question. \nIMMUNE POWER: IMAGES, FICTIONS, AND FIXA nONS \nThis chapter opened with a reminder that science has been a travel \ndiscourse, intimately implicated in the other great colonizing and liberatory \nreadings and writings so basic to modern constitutions and dissolutions of \nthe marked bodies of race, sex, and class. The colonizing and the liberatory, \nand the constituting and the dissolving, are related as internal images. So I \ncontinue this tour through the science museum of immunology's cultures \nwith the 'land, hoi' effect described by my colleague, James Clifford, as we \nwaited in our university chancellor's office for a meeting in 1986. The \nchancellor's office walls featured beautiful colour-enhanced photographic \nportraits of the outer planets of earth's solar system. Each 'photograph' \ncreated the effect for the viewer of having been there. It seemed some other \nobserver must have been there, with a perceptual system like ours and a good \ncamera; somehow it must have been possible to see the land masses o[Jupiter \nand Saturn coming into view of the great ships of Vl<J'ager as they crossed the \nempty reaches of space. Twentieth-century people are used to the idea that \nall photographs are constructs in some sense, and that the appearance that a \nphotograph gives of being a 'message without a code', that is, what is \npictured being simply tilere, is an effect of many layers of history, including \nprominently, technology (Barthes, 1982; Haraway, 1984-5; Petchesky, \n1987). But the photographs of the outer planets up the ante on this issue by \norders of magnitude. The wonderful pictures have gone through processes \nof construction that make the metaphor of the 'eye of the camera' completely \nmisleading. The chancellor's snapshot of Jupiter is a postmodern photo-\ngraphic portrait - a denatured construct of the first order, which has the \neffect of utter naturalistic realism. Someone was there. Land, hoi But that \nsomeone was a spaceship that sent back digitalized signals to a whole world of \ntransformers and imagers on a distant place called 'earth', where art \nphotographs could be produced to give a reassuring sense of the tilermess of \nJupiter, and, not incidentally, of spacemen, or at least virtual spacemen, whose \neyes would see in the same colour spectrum as an earthly primate's. \n",

This approach to disease involved a \nstunning reversal: the colonized was perceived as the invader. In the face of \nthe disease genocides accompanying European 'penetration' of the globe, \nthe 'coloured' body of the colonized was constructed as the dark source of \ninfection, pollution, disorder, and so on, that threatened to overwhelm white \nmanhood (cities, civilization, the family, the white personal body) with its \ndecadent emanations. In establishing the game parks of Africa, European \nlaw turned indigenous human inhabitants of the 'nature reserves' into \npoachers, invaders in their own terrain, or into part of the wildlife. The \nresidue of the history of colonial tropical medicine and natural history in late \ntwentiety-century immune discourse should not be underestimated. Dis-\ncourses on parasitic diseases and AIDS provide a surfeit of examples. \nThe tones of colonial discourse are also audible in the opening paragraphs \nof Immunology: The Scimce if Non-Self Discrimination, where the dangers to \nindividuality are almost lasciviously recounted. The first danger is 'fusion of \nindividuals': \nIn a jungle or at the bottom of the sea, organisms - especially plants, but \nalso all kinds of sessile animals - are often in such close proximity that \nthey are in constant danger oflosing their individuality by fusion ... But \nonly in the imagination of an artist does all-out fusion occur; in reality, \norganisms keep pretty much separate, no matter how near to one another \nthey live and grow. (Klein, 1982, p. 3) \nIn those exotic, allotropic places, any manner of contact might occur to \nthreaten proper mammalian self-definition. Harmony of the organism, that \nfavourite theme of biologists, is explained in terms of the aggressive defence \nof individuality; and Klein advocates devoting as much time in the under-\ngraduate biology curriculum to defence as to genetics and evolution. It reads \na bit like the defence departroent fighting the social services budget for \nfederal funds. Immunology for Klein is 'intraorganismic defense reaction', \nproceding by 'recognition, processing, and response'. Klein defines 'self' as \n'everything constituting an integral part of a given individual' (1982, p. 5; \nemphasis in original). What counts as an individual, then, is the nub of the \nmatter. Everything else is 'not-self' and elicits a defence reaction if \n",

But this chapter has repeatedly tried to make \nproblematic just what does count as self, within the discourses of biology and \nmedicine, much less in the postmodern world at large. \nA diagram of the 'Evolution of Recognition Systems' in a recent \nimmunology textbook makes clear the intersection of the themes of literally \n'wonderful' diversity, escalating complexity, the self as a defended strong-\nhold, and extra-terrestrialism (Plate 1 I). Under a diagram culminating in the \nevolution of the mammals, represented without COmment by a mouse and a \nfully-SIIited spacemall,11 who appears to be stepping out, perhaps on the \nsurface of the moon, is this explanation: \nFrom the humble amoeba searching for food (top left) to the mammal \nwith its sophisticated humoral and cellular immune mechanisms (boltom \nright), the process of 'self versus non-self recognition' shows a steady \ndevelopment, keeping pace with the increasing need of animals to \nmaintain their integrity in a hostile environment. The decision at which \npoint 'immunity' appeared is thus a purely semantic one'. (Playfair, 1984, \np. 3; emphasis in original) \nThese are the semantics of defence and invasion. When is a self enough of a \nself that its boundaries become central to entire institutionalized discourses \nin medicine, war, and business? Immunity and invulnerability are intersect-\ning concepts, a matter of consequence in a nuclear culture unable to \naccommodate the experience of death and finirude within available liberal \ndiscourse on the collective and personal individual. Life is a window of \nvulnerability. It seems a mistake to close it. Tne perfection of the fully \ndefended, 'victorious' self is a chilling fantasy, linking phagocytotic amoeba \nand moon-voyaging man cannibalizing the earth in an evolutionary teleology \nof post-apocalypse extra-terrestrialism. It is a chilling fantasy, whether \nlocated in the abstract spaces of national discourse, or in the equally abstract \nspaces of our interior bodies. \nImages of the immune system as battlefield abound in science sections of \ndaily newspapers and in popular magazines, for example, Time magazine's \n1984 graphic for the AIDS virus's 'invasion' of the cell-as-factory. The virus \nis imaged as a tank, and the viruses ready for export from the expropriated \ncells are lined up as tanks ready to continue their advance on the body as a \nproductive force. The Natiollal Geographic explicitly punned on Star Wars in \nits graphic entitled 'Cell Wars' in Jaret's 'The Wars Within' (1986, pp. \n708-9). The battle imagery is conventional, not unique to a nuclear and \nCold War era, but it has taken on all the specific markings of those particular \nhistorical crises. The militarized, automated factory is a favourite convention \namong immune system illustrators and photographic processors.

The immune system has become a lucrative terrain of \nself-development practices, a SCene where contending forms of power are \nevoked and practised. In Dr. Berger's Immulle Power Diet, the 'invincible you' \nis urged to 'put immune power to work for you' by using your 'IQ (Immune \nQ)Jotient), (Berger, 1985, p. 186). In the great tradition of evangelical \npreaching, the reader is asked if 'You are ready to make the immune power \ncommitment?' (1985, p. 4). In visualization self-help, the sufferer learns in a \nstate of deep relaxation to image the processes of disease and healing, in \norder both to gain more control in many senses and to engage in a kind of \nmeditation on the meanings of living and dying from an embodied vantage \npoint in the microplaces of the postmodern body. These visualization \nexercises need not be prototypes for Star Wars, but they often are in the \nadvice literature. The Natiollal Geographic endorses this approach in its \ndescription of one such effort: 'Combining fun and therapy, a young cancer \npatient at the M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, Texas, zaps cancer cells \nin the \"Killer T Cell\" video game' (Jaret, 1987, p. 705).

As with any function, \n'work' for what cannot remain unexamined, and not just in tenns of the \nstatistics of cancer survival. Imaging is one of the vectors in the 'epidemics of \nsignification' spreading in the cultures of postmodern therapeutics.

As cyborgs in this field of \nmeanings, how can 'we', late-twentieth-century Westerners, image our \nvulnerability as a window on to life? \nImmunity can also be conceived in terms of shared specificities; of the \nsemi-permeable self able to engage with others (human and non-human, \ninner and outer), but always with finite consequences; of situated possibil-\nities and impossibilities of individuation and identification; and of partial \nfusions and dangers. The problematic multiplicities of postmodern selves, so \npotently figured alld repressed in the lumpy discourses of inImunology, must \nbe brought into other emerging Western and multi-cultural discourses on \nhealth, sickness, individuality, humanity, and death. \nThe science fictions of the black American writer, Octavia Butler, invite \n",

Drawing \non the resources of black and women's histories and liberatory movements, \nButler has been consumed with an interrogation into the boundaries of what \ncounts as human and into the limits of the concept and practices of claiming \n'property in the self' as the ground of 'human' individuality and selfhood.ln \nClay's Ark (1984) Butler explores the consequences of an extra-terrestrial \ndisease invading earth in the bodies of rerumed spacemen. The invaders \nhave become an intimate part of all the cells of the infected bodies, changing \nhuman beings at the level of their most basic selves. The invaders havc a \nsingle imperative that they enforce on their hosts: replication. Indeed, Clays \nArk reads like The Extended Phenotype; the invaders seem disrurbingly like the \n'ultimate' unit of selection that haunts the biopolitical imaginations of \nposunodem evolutionary theorists and economic planners. Thc humans in \nButler's profoundly dystopic story struggle to maintain their own areas of \nchoice and self-definition in the face of the disease they have become. Part \nof their task is to craft a transformed relation to the 'other' within themselves \nand to the children born to infected parents. The offsprings' quadruped \nform archetypically marks them as the Beast itself, but they are also the \nfurure of what it will mean to be human. The disease will be global. Thc task \nof the multi-racial women and men of Clay's Ark comes to be to reinvent the \ndialectics of self and other within the emerging epidemics of signification \nsignalled by extra-terrestrialism in inner and outer space. Success is not \njudged in this book; only the naming of the task is broached. \nIn Dawn, the first novel of Butler's series on Xenogenesis, the themes of \nglobal holocaust and the threateningly intimate other as self emerge again. \nButler's is a fiction predicated on the narural starus of adoption and the \nunnarural violence of kin. Butler explores the interdigitations of human, \nmachine, non-human animal or alien, and their mutants, especially in \nrelation to the intimacies of bodily exchange and mental communication. \nHer fiction in the opening novel of Xenogenesis is about the monstrous fcar \nand hope that the child will not, after all, be like the parent. There is never \none parent. Monsters share more than the word's root with the verb 'to \ndemonstrate'; monsters signifY. Butler's fiction is about resistance to the \nimperative to recreate the sacred image of the same (Butler, 1978). Butler is \nlike 'Doris Lessing, Marge Piercy, Joanna Russ, Ursula LeGuin, Margaret \nAtwood, and Christa Wolf, [for whom] reinscribing the narrative of \ncatastrophe engages them in the invention of an alternate fictional world in \nwhich the other (gender, race, species) is no longer subordinated to the \nsame' (Brewer, 1987, p. 46). \nCatastrophe, survival, and metamorphosis are Butler's constant themes. \nFrom the perspective of an ontology based on mutation, metamorphosis, and \nthe diaspora, restoring an original sacred image can be a bad joke.

At the end of Dawn, Butler has Lilith - whose name \nrecalls her original unfaithful double, the repudiated wife of Adam -\npregnant with the child of five progenitors, who come from two species, at \nleast three genders, two sexes, and an indeterminate number of races. \nPreoccupied with marked bodies, Butler writes not of Cain or Ham, but of \nLilith, the woman of colour whose confrontations with the terms of selfhood, \nsurvival, and reproduction in the face of repeated ultimate catastrophe \npresage an ironic salvation history, with a salutary twist on the promise of a \nwoman who will crush the head of the serpent. Butler's salvation history is \nnot utopian, but remains deeply furrowed by the contradictions and \nquestions of power within all communication. Therefore, her narrative has \nthe possibility of figuring something other than the Second Coming of the \nsacred image. Some other order of difference might be possible in \nXenogenesis - and in immunology. \nIn the story, Lilith Iyapo is a young American black woman rescued with a \nmotley assortment of remnants of humanity from an earth in the grip of \nnuclear war. Like all the surviving humans, Lilith has lost everything. Her \nson and her second-generation Nigerian-American husband had died in an \naccident before the war. She had gone back to school, vaguely thinking she \nmight become an anthropologist. But nuclear catastrophe, even more \nradically and comprehensively than the slave trade and history's other great \ngenocides, ripped all rational and narural connections with past and furure \nfrom her and everyone else. Except for intermittent periods of questioning, \nthe human remnant is kept in suspended animation for 250 years by the \nOankali, the alien species that originally believed humanity was intent on \ncommitting suicide and so would be far too dangerous to try to save. Without \nhuman sensory organs, the Oankali are primatoid Medusa figures, their \nheads and bodies covered with multi-talented tentacles like a terran marine \ninvertebrate's. These humanoid serpent people speak to the woman and \nurge her to touch them in an intimacy that would lead humanity to a \nmonstrous metamorphosis. Multiply stripped, Lilith fights for survival, \nagency, and choice on the shifting boundaries that shape the possibility of \nmeaning. \nThe Oankali do not rescue human beings only to rerum them unchanged \nto a restored earth. Their own origins lost to them through an infinitely long \nseries of mergings and exchanges reaching deep into time and space, the \nOankali are gene traders. Their eSSence is embodied commerce, conversa-\ntion, communication - with a vengeance. Their narure is always to be \nmidwife to themselves as other. Their bodies themselves are immune and \ngenetic technologies, driven to exchange, replication, dangerous intimacy \nacross the boundaries of self and other, and the power of images. Not unlike \n",

Rather, they \nare complexly webbed into a universe of living machines, all of which are \npartners in their apparatus of bodily production, including the ship on which \nthe action of Dawn takes place. But deracinated captive fragments of \nhumanity packed into the body of the aliens' ship inescapably evoke the \nterrible Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade that brought Lilith's \nancestors to a 'New World'. There also the terms of sunival were premised \non an unfree 'gene trade' that permanently altered meanings of self and \nother for all the 'parmers' in the exchange. In Butler's science fictional \n'middle passage' the resting humans sleep in tamed carnivorous plant-like \npods, while the Oankali do what they can to heal the ruined earth. Much is \nlost for ever, but the fragile layer of life able to sustain other life is restored, \nmaking earth ready for recolonization by large animals. The Oankali are \nintensely interested in humans as potential exchange parmers partly because \nhumans are built from such beautiful and dangerous genetic structures. The \nOankali believe humans to be fatally, but reparably, flawed by their genetic \nnature as simultaneously intelligent and hierarchical. Instead, the aliens live \nin the postrnodern geometries of vast webs and nerworks, in which the nodal \npoints of individuals are still intensely important. These webs are hardly \ninnocent of power and violence; hierarchy is not power's only shape - for \naliens or humans. The Oankali make 'prints' of all their refugees, and they \ncan print out replicas of the humans from these mental-organic-technical \nimages. The replicas allow a great deal of gene trading. The Oankali are also \nfascinated with Lilith's 'talent' for cancer, which killed several of her \nrelatives, but which in Oankali 'hands' would become a technology for \nregeneration and metamorphoses. But the Oankali want more from human-\nity; they want a full trade, which will require the intimacies of sexual \nmingling and embodied pregnancy in a shared colonial venture in, of all \nplaces, the Amazon valley. Human individuality will be challenged by more \nthan the Oankali communication technology that translates other beings into \nthemselves as signs, images, and memories. Pregnancy raises the tricky \nquestion of consent, property in the self, and the humans' love of themselves \nas the sacred image, the sign of the same. The Oankali intend to return to \nearth as trading parmers with humanity's remnants. In difference is the \nirretrievable loss of the illusion of the one. \nLilith is chosen to train and lead the first party of awakened humans. She \nwill be a kind of midwife/mother for these radically atomized peoples' \nemergence from their cocoons. Their task will be to form a community. But \nfirst Lilith is paired in an Oankali family with the just pre-metamorphic \nyoungster, Nikanj, an ooloi.

Endowed with a second pair of arms, an adult \nooloi is the third gender of the Oankali, a neuter beeing who uses its special \nappendages to mediate and engineer the gene trading of the species and of \neach family. Each child among the Oankali has a male and female parent, \nusually sister and brother to each other, and an ooloi from another group, \nrace, or moitie. One translation in Oankali langnages for ooloi is 'treasured \nstrangers'. The ooloi will be the mediators among the four other parents of \nthe planned cross-species children. Heterosexuality remains unquestioned, \nif more complexly mediated. The different social subjects, the different \ngenders that could emerge from another embodiment of resistance to \ncompulsory heterosexual reproductive politics, do not inhabit this Dawn. \nThe treasured strangers can give intense pleasure across the boundaries \nof group, sex, gender, and species. It is a fatal pleasure that marks Lilith for \nthe other awakened humans, even though she has not yet consented to a \npregnancy. Faced with her bodily and mental alterations and her bonding \nwith Nikanj, the other humans do not trust that she is still human, whether \nor not she bears a human-alien child. Neither does Lilith. Worrying that she \nis none the less a Judas-goat, she undertakes to train the humans with the \nintention that they will survive and run as soon as they return to earth, \nkeeping their humanity as people before them kept theirs. In the training \nperiod, each female human pairs with a male human, and then each pair, \nwilling or not, is adopted by an adult ooloi. Lilith loses her Chinese-\nAmerican lover, Joseph, who is murdered by the suspicious and enraged \nhumans. At the end, the first group of humans, estranged from their ooloi \nand hoping to escape, are ready to leave for earth. Whether they can still be \nfertile without their ooloi is doubtful. Perhaps it is more than the individual \nof a sexually reproducing species who always has more than one parent; the \nspecies too might require multiple mediation of its replicative biopolitics. \nLilith finds she must remain behind to train another group, her return to \nearth indefinitely deferred. But Nikanj has made her pregnant with Joseph's \nsperm and the genes of its own mates. Lilith has not consented, and the first \nbook of Xenogenesis leaves her with the ooloi's uncomprehending comfort \nthat 'The differences will be hidden until metamorphosis' (Butler, 1987, p. \n263). Lilith remains unreconciled: 'But they won't be human. That's what \nmatters. You can't understand, but that is what matters.' The treasured \nstranger responds, 'The child inside you matters' (p. 263). Butler does not \nresolve this dilemma. The contending shapes of sameness and difference in \nany possible future are at stake in the unfinished narrative of traffic across \nthe specific cultural, biotechnical, and political boundaries that separate and \nlink animal, human, and machine in a contemporary global world where \nsurvival is at stake.

The human sociology source Wilson cities is Murrell (1965). \n26 \nThroughout 0\" Human Naturc, Wilson uses the technological metaphors of the \ndevelopmental geneticist, C.H. Waddington (1957). \n27 \nTranscending a critique of sexism as explicit justification of sex role differentiation, a \nfeminist theory of knowledge addressing the fundamental dualism of man and nature, \nmind and body, controller and controlled, has begun to appear in many disciplinary and \npractical c~ntexts. See Hartsock (1983a, 1983b), Harding (1978), Merchant (1980), \nGriffin (1978), all of which construct a kind of feminist humanism. The most important \nnon-feminist critique of humanism as a logic of domination is Foucault (1970). \n.. In the Beginning Was the Word: The Genesis of Biological Theory \nMerchant (1980) analyses the metaphors of female Narure in her transformation from \nnurturing mother to patient resource in Europe from the fifteenth to the eighteenth \ncentury. Dominating narure was possible within bOlh metaphor (and social) systems, but \nall limits seem to disappear in the capitalist form of patriarchy. Merchant helps in seeing \nthis scientific-humanistic dialectic of apocalypse. \n2 \nThis language is Barash's: on knowing the self nnd free will (1979, pp. 90, 233-4); on \nbiogranunar (p. 10); on the variable iCing/constant cake theory of culture and biology \n(pp. JG-I 1). While claiming mat he, speaking for science, is giving 'plain facts' (pp. 25, \n29, 44, J Il, Il6), Barash uses insistently phallic language throughout the book: \npollination becomes floral 'rape' in which male flowers 'bombard female flowers I and \ngrow a pollen tube which 'forces its way to the ovary' (p. 30). Harem masters abound, \nand Barash savours the language of LeBoeuf, who srudied nursing elephant seal puppies \nin sociobiological terms of 'double mother-suckers', 'super weaners', and, now in \nBarash's phrase, 'evolutionary stars'. Barash's lesson from these patriarchal puns is that \nmales take evolutionary risks and win big when they 'strike it rich'. Be a female only if \nyou have no choicei females must be content with 'modest evolutionary success' (p. 59)· \n3 \nIn the 'Acknowledgments', Barash recognizes his lover as his 'co-shareholder in my \nfitness' . \n4 \n'Marxists' seem to be chief among these comfortable weaklings (Barash, 1979, ch. 8). \n5 \nThe funniest extended example of Barash's rhetoric of persuasion by patrilineal naming \nis his introduction of Robert T rivers's theory of parental investment - as if cost-benefit \nanalysis would startle anyone since at least the early nineteenth century. \nTruly new and exciting ideas come along only rarely, even in science. I was privileged \nto be at the public unveiling of one of these ideas. It was December 1972, and the \noccasion Was the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement \nof Science in Washington, D.C. The fearured symposium on the 'ecology and \nevolution of social behavior' was nearly completed when Harvard sociobiologist \nRobert Trivers begun speaking. He used no notes, seeming to figure it all Qut as he \nwent along, but I'm sure he wasn't doing anything of the sort. In any event, it was \narresting - and brilliant. When the young Huxley first read Darwin, he is said to have \nexclaimed, 'How stupid of me not to have thought of this!' The ideas Bob Trivers \npresented that day had much the same appeal as Darwin's work - simple, elegant, \nimportant, and almost incontrovertiblY,true'. (Barash, 1979, p. 125) \n",

Barash disavows seeking moral dictation from his science but enthusiastically \nendorses sociobiology's medical voice - especially in assessing mental health in terms of \nfitness-maximization behaviour (1979, pp. 214-15). The collapsing of morality into \nhealth is an old rhetorical strategy. \nWashburn's opposition to sociobiology is an example of his complexity and of the \ninadequacy of some feminist critiques of his role as the chief author of the man-the-\nhunter theory in the history of physical anthropology. \nL~a Leibowitz and Ruth Bleier highlight iUogical evidence and special pleading in \nammal model research. Freda Salzman criticizes Maccoby and Jacklin on the relation of \naggression and gender. Marian Lowe and Ruth Hubbard show the deep and shoddy \nsimilarities in E.O. Wilson's sociobiology and Alice Rossi's biosociology. Susan Leigh \nStar explores lateralization research in neurophysiology, and Janice Raymond argues the \nmedicalization of moral~political issues through transexual surgery. Hubbard and Lowe \nprovide the project's summary and theoretical framing. \nLatour and Woolgar (1979) provide a comprehensive analysis of the epistemological and \nma~erial facto~s involved in the production of facts packaged in objects solid enough to \nweigh and mad to colleagues. They calculated the cost per published paper from a Nobel \nPrize-winning research project in a productive Salk lnstirute laboratory. The word is not \ncheap. \nPhilosopher Noretta Koertge made the same point at the 1980 National Women's \nS~dies Association meetings when she described a memory of herself at four years old \nbeing scolded by her mother for masturbating. Her mother claimed the act was naughty \nand would make her nervous. Little Noretta knew that she could never win on the \nnaughty issue but that her mother might be wrong about the nervous part. Moral: \nscience is a feminist resourcei falsifiability is a feminist issue. \nFor example, Bleier, writing in Hubbard and Lowe (1979) on animal srudies applied to \nhumans, tried to have all arguments all ways as long as they come OUt right for feminists. \nBeginning with the premise that '[S]cience is a cultural institution', she still posited that \n'the structure of science has its edges pure and probing into the knowable unknown'. But \npollution results from the 'massive core' which perpetuates dominant social values (p. \n49)· Later she argues: (I) there is a real science with unclouded vision, feminist science, \nfor example, Jane Lancaster's conclusions (p. 57) on primate behaviour are 'more \nrational', though why Lancaster can engage in a science of sex differences and escape \n~ale ~Iouded vision is unexplained; (2) real science of sex differences is impossible for \nhlstoncal reasons; (3) such a science does exist and has yielded feminist facts and \nconclusions (PP' 58, 63-4); and (4) drawing on French feminist standpoints, 'All that \nremains to do is to write and speak ourselves into being; to construct a new language, a \nnew scholarship, a new knowledge that is whole' (p. 66). Pure edges, massive cores \n~egrees of rati~nality,. and French feminist theories that language constitutes reali~ \nImply mutually mconslstent epistemologies.

Various \narticles note that women producing current science have had the social role of \nsubordinates in the scientific~technical work-force.

A crucial part of this later story is the emergence of the chimpanzee as the \nmost formidable candidate for modelling hominid evolution. But, not focusing on the \nchimpanzee, Strum, Lancaster, and Thelma Rowell told markedly different stories \nabout the meanings of baboons, vervets, and patas monkeys. I think they de-emphasize \nDeVore's baboons in part because a widespread women's movement altered what both \nmale and female primatologists heard, saw, and believed. Jay never indicated that she \nthought langurs ought to be privileged models for hominid evolution.

Caution is necessary in interpreting the language of papers \ncranslated, often badly, from Japanese. \nHrdy (1981) develops her arguments about the biological inheritance of human primate \nfemales in comparison with other living primate females in The Woman That N(I)tr \nEvolved. The females populating her book are assertive, competitive, various, independ~ \nent - but not necessarily dominant. Hrdy regards human females to be in one of the \nworst positions vis-a-vis their male conspecifics, partiy as a function of human male \nconcrol of property. Harvard University Press again outdid itself in advertising strategies: \nin 1981 issues of the N(W York Rroiw of Books, the press pictured a piece of stitchery, \ndrawing on prominent contemporary feminist metaphors of quilting and stitchery and on \nboth feminist and anti-feminist rhetorics for valuing women's traditional work positively. \nThe Harvard sociobiological stitchery says, 'A woman's place is in the jungle.' Hrdy \nstresses that feminism and its product, human female equality, are a fragile historical-\npolitical achievement, not a biological inheritance. That the reviewer (Henry, 1982) in \nthe influential radical feminist publication, Off Our Backs, enthusiastically endorsed The \nWoman 17uJI Nroer Evoiv,d indicates the complexil)' of ideological alignments over \nsociobiological claims. Henry argued that 'Every aspect of [Hrdy's] book reflects a \nfeminist perspective ... I find it amazing that she could survive Harvard to write this ... \nIf Harvard University Press gets this important book out in paperback, maybe Hrdy cnn \nreach those to whom it is dedicated: \"the liberated woman who never evolved ... n' (pp. \n18-lg). Of course, Hrdy 'survived' Harvard with the patrilineal connection to the major \nmale SOciobiologists, who have been condemned by Off Our Backs, among other feminist \npublications, as the embodiment of scientific patriarchal purveyors of the biological \ndeterminism of female inferiority. Hrdy was a research associate; DeVore and Wilson \nwere full professors. Hrdy was a mentor for Harvard physical anthropology women \ngraduate students. Further, her explicit self-identification as a feminist was important in \nher view of the history of evolutionary theory (Hrdy and Williams, Ig83). Obviously, the \nsituation is more complex than 'simple' doctrinal alignments around sociobiology \nindicate. \nZuckennan (1933), Lindberg (lg67), Tanner and Zihlman (1976), Zihlman (1978a, \n1978b, 1978c). \nAlthough Lancaster and Zihlman were not close collaborators, they shared the \nexcitement of their new ideas and exchanged letters and manuscripts during the \nmid-I970S when so many women were using inherited tools to craft new stories. \nLancaster to Zihlman (23 August 1976) expresses her pleasure at Zihlman's twist on the \noestrus, sexual selection, and female choice tale. Thanks to Adrienne Zihlman for access \nto her correspondence file. \nSexual reproduction and female sexuality continue to figure in opposing new \nhypotheses for reconstructing hominid evolution, and tales of the past continue to be \npregnant with the structure of possibilities for the future. For a blatant rejuvenation of \nmale control of female sexualil)' (the pair bond) as the key to most aspects of hominid \nlife, see Lovejoy (lg8t). That this paper was able to be published in a major journal \nwithout citing crucial evidence and publications on its major points is itself the subject \nfor analysiS on the estllblishment of scientific authority.

Thanks especially to the organizers of the \nconference (Deborah Gordon, Lisa Bloom, Vivek Dareshawar) and co-member of the \npanel (Teresa de Lauretis). \n2 \nFeminist theorist, bell hooks, emphasized the difference between the noun, as in 'the \nwomen's movement', with the potential for pernicious taxonomies and vanguardism \ninherent in this curious substantive, contrasted to the more active verb-like fonn, as in \n'women's movement\" that resists reification and claims to special political correcmess \n(hooks, 1981, 1984). AVOiding the pitfalls ofliberal definitions emphasizing 'equality of \nrights', hooks argued, 'Feminism is the struggle to end sexist oppression. Its aim is not to \nbenefit solely any specific group of women, any particular race or class of women. It does \nnot privilege women over men. It has the power to transform in a meaningful way all our \nlives' (hooks, 1984, p. 26). Feminist movement is thus directed at the 'cultural basis of \ngroup oppression ... This would mean that race and class oppression would be \nrecognized as feminist issues with as much relevance as sexism' (p. 25). Thanks to Katie \nKing for reminding me of hooks's usage, and also for much else in my understllnding of \nthe detailed apparatuses of production of women's culture and women's experience \n(King, 1986, 1988, forthcoming). \n3 \nAt the heart of US feminist theory in the 1980s has been an effort to articulate the \nspecificity of location from which politics and knowledge must be built. The earlier \nfonnulation that lthe personal is political' intersected with and has been transformed by \nrepresentations of the webs of women's local and global p05itionings, resulting in a \nmajor transformation of the forms and contents of feminist movement. One of the \nwritten traces is a large network of implicit intertextuality and explicit citation in feminist \npublishing. See, for example, Mohanty's (1988, p. 43) citation of Adrienne Rich's (1986) \n'Notes toward 11 politics of location' and Bernice Johnson Reagan's (1983) originary \n'Coalition politics'. Mohanty repeats, as I do, Rich's line from 'North American tunnel \nvision,' published first in 1983: 'It was not enough to say\" As a woman I have no country; \nas a woman my country is the whole world\" ... Magnificent as that vision may be, we \ncannot explode into breadth without a conscious grasp on the particular and concrete \nmeaning of our location here and now, in the United Stlltes of America' (Rich, 1986, p. \n162). Neither Rich, Reagan, Mohanty, nor I disavow the hope of world-wide feminist \nconnection, which, located within the estllblished disorder of the United States, I call the \nhope for an 'elsewhere' in an appropriation of SF tropes. This kind of 'elsewhere' is \nbrought into being Out of feminist movement rooted in specification and articulation, not \nout of common 'identities' nor assumption of the right or ability of any particular to \n'represent' the general. The 'particular' in feminist movement is not about liberal \nindividualism nor a despairing isolation of endless differences, much less about rejecting \nthe hope for collective movement. But the means and processes of collective movement \nmust be imagined and acted out in new geometries. That is why I find the reading and \nwriting strategies of SF (speculative fiction, science fiction, science fantasy, speculative \nfeminism) so useful for feminist theOrizing. \n4 \nTrinh T. Minh-ha (lg86---J, pp. 3-38; 1988, pp. 71-7; 1989) discusses this ungraspable \nmiddle space and develops her theory of the 'inappropriateld other' as a figure for post-\ncolonial women.

Examining \nanother practice, Mohanty (1984) pointed out how feminist publishing, for example, \nmany of London's Zed Press books on Third World women, were part of the apparatus \nof production of the 'Third World Woman' as an essentialized icon of super-oppression. \nThis woman, at the bottom of cascades of oppression, then became the privileged \npotentially revolutionary subject in feminist discourses on 'liberation'. Her condition \nrepresented allegorically the state of Woman as victim coming to consciousness. See the \nZed Books catalogue, Spring 1988/Spring 1989, for a complete list. There are many \nways of reading these Zed books, many of which do not fit Mohanty's analysis. But these \nbooks collectively have been part of a feminist apparatus of production of the Third \nWorld Woman as a site of discourse for many agendas. This is one concrete example of a \nfeminist constitution of experience as a discursive object and its appropriation in \ninternational networks. In the words of the Zed catalogue, 'For more than a decade Zed \nBooks has been publishing outstanding writing by and about women of the Third World \n... Widely read throughout the world, many are now used in educational institutions \nand as an essential reference in libraries.' There is nothing innocent (nor inherently evil) \nabout such a process; the political and epistemological problems centre around \naccountability and the power-charged technologies of representation, including 'selr-\nrepresentation. Ong (1987) describes how young Malay women factory workers are \ncontested sites of discourse, where others struggle to set the terms for religious \nauthority, national identity, and family honour. Corporations, state official and opposi-\ntional Islamic organizations, the national mass media, and popular street discourse all \ncompete to represent the sexuality of the women. Dog also discursively constructs the \nwomen - in her narrative as complex historical actors affirming their humanity in \nmultiply constrained frameworks where gender, age, region, ethnicity, nation, and class \nare especially salient (Haraway, 1989a). All constructions of women as sites of discourse \nare not equal; to point out their circuits of production and distrlbution is not to forbid \nthe process, but to attempt to engage it with deliberate accountability. Both Ong and \nMani (1987) are excellent examples of feminist efforts to do just that. What they never \nclaim is that their representations - even or especially of women representing themselves \n- precipitate out of the solution of discourse and give the 'experience', 'voice', or \n'empirical reality' of women 1m-mediately to the reader. This entire issue is strongly \nanalogous to the impossibility of representations of nature precipitating out of scientific \ndiscourses to reveal 'narure herself'. \nOn Emecheta see Schipper (1985, pp. 44-6), Bruner (1983, pp. 49-50). For the \nchanging book jacket copy see Emecheta (1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1982, 1983a, \nb, (985).

Writing of Alicia Dujovne Ortiz's novel BUt/lOS \nAires, Kaplan fonnulated a reading practice that might also be engaged from Emecheta's \nnovels: 'Buenos Aires reinvents identity as a form of selfconscious cultural criticism. \nDisplacement is a force in the modem world which can be reckoned with, not to heal \nsplits but to explore them, to acknowledge the politics and limits of cultural processes' \n(Kaplnn 1986-7. p. 98). \n",

See especially Jewell Handy Gresham, 'The politics of \nfamily in America', pp. U6-22. See also Collins (1989a, 1989b) for an analysis of the \nattacks on black mothers and families in the last twenty years in the US and me use of \ngender to demonstrate racia1 inferiority. Carby (1987) analyses black women's discourse \non mothering and racia1 uplift in me late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in \nterms of a specific non-racist and non-patriarchal reconstruction of womllnhood. A \nmajor intervention in feminist literary theory, Carby's book develops a 'feminist critical \npractice that pays particular attention to the articulation of gender, race, and class' (p. \n17)· She argues that 'Black feminist criticism be regarded critically as a problem, not a \nsolution, as a sign that should be interrogated, a locus of contradictions' (p. 15). Thus, \nCarby is suspicious of Christian's - and, by my extension, of Ogunyemi's - historical \nnlllTative of the literary progression of black women writers and her method of \nconstructing a maturing tradition, which Carby sees as highly problematic (p. 14). Carby \ndisagrees with the frequent dismissa1 by critics of nineteenth- and twentieth-century \nblack fiction, including Christian, of the mulatta figure as an attempt to counter white \naudiences' negative images of black people. Carby argues that the mulatto/a as a \nnarrative figure works as a 'vehicle for an exploration of relation between the races and, \nat the same time, an expression of me relationship between the races. The figure of the \nmulatto should be understood and analyzed as a narrative device of mediation' (p. 89). \nCarby also foregrounds the black as well as white readership for black writing before the \nlast twenty years and insists that the writing by black women in the late nineteenth and \nearly twentieth centuries represents Ian earlier and perhaps more politically resonant \nrenaissance [than the \"black women's renaissance\" conditionally certified by Hollywood, \nacademia, and big publishing houses in the 1980s1 so we may rethink the cultural politics \nof black women' (p. 7). These debates over the narratives of black literary and political \nhistory -\ncast in the figures of decades, traditions, pivotal writers, and literary \ncharacterizations - are pre-eminently debates about contemporary politics. They are \nalso methodological debates over how to do cultural studies. Carby drinks deeply from \nthe work in England associated with Stuart Hall. The contested and heterogeneous \ndiscourse of US 'black feminist criticism' could be traced from Smith (1977). \n7.

But, as easily, the total collapse of the category of race into \nbiologism is linguistically invited. All these matters continue to hinge on unexamined \nfunctioning of the productionist, Aristotelian logic fundamental to so much Western \ndiscourse. In this linguistic, political, and historical matrix, matter and fonn, act and \npotency, raw material and achieved product play out their escalating dramas of \nproduction and appropriation. Here is where subjects and objects get born and endlessly \nreincarnated. \nAlthough not murually exclusive, the language of 'gender' in Euro-American feminist \ndiscourse usually is the language of 'sexed subject position' and 'sexual difference' in \nEuropean writing. For British Marxist feminism on the 'sexed subject in patriarchy', see \nKuhn and Wolpe (1978), Marxist-Feminist Literature Collective (1978), Brown and \nAdams (1979), the journal mlf, Barrett (1980). Gennan socialist-feminist positions on \nsexualization have stressed the dialectic of women's self-constructing agency, already \nstrucrured social determinations, and partial restrucrurings. This literarure examines \nhow women construct themselves into existing strucrure~, in order to find the point \nwhere change might be possible. If women are theorized as passive victims of sex and \ngender as a system of domination, no theory of liberation will be possible. So social \nconstructionism on the question of gender must not be allowed to become a theory of \nclosed determinism (Haug, 1980, 1982; Haug et 01., 1983, 1987; Mouffe, 1983). \nLooking for a theory of experience, of how women actively embody themselves, the \nwomen in the collective writing the Fraurnformrn publications insisted on a descriptive! \ntheoretical practice showing 'the ways we live ourselves in bodily terms' (Haug eI 01., \n1987, p. 30). They evolved a method called 'memory work' that emphasizes collectively \ncriticized, written narratives about 'a stranger', a past 'remembered' self, while \nproblematizing the self-deluding assumptions of autobiography and other causal \naccounts. The problem is to account for the emergence of 'the sexual itself as the \nprocess that produces the insertion of women into, and their subordination within, \ndeterminate social practices' (p. 33). Ironically, self-constituted as sexualized, as woman, \nwomen cannot be accountable for themselves or society (p. 27). Like all the theories of \nsex, sexuality, and gender surveyed in this effort to write for a standard reference work \nthat inevitably functions to canonize some meanings over others, the Fraurn/onnen \nversions insist on gender as a gerund or a verb, rather than a finished noun, a \nsubstantive. For feminists, gender means making and unmaking 'bodies' in a contestable \nworld; an account of gender is a theory of experience as signifYing and significant \nembodiment. \nJoan Scott (1988, pp. 28-50) wrote an incisive treattnent of the development of gender \nas a theoretical category in the discipline of history. She noted the long history of play on \nthe grammatical gender difference for making figurative allusions to sex or character (p. \n28). Scott quoted as her epigram FOrP/~'s Dictionary of Modem Eng/ish Usage's insistence \nthat to use gender to mean the male or female sex was either a mistake or a joke. The \nironies in this injunction abound. One benefit of the inheritance of feminist uses of \ngender from grammar is that, in that domain, 'gender is understood to be a way of \nclassifying phenomena, a socially agreed-upon system of distinctions, rather than an \nobjective description of inherent traits' (p. 29). \nSee Coward (1983, chs 5 and 6) for a thorough discussion of the concepts of the family \nand the woman question in Marxist thought from 1848 to about 1930. \nRubin (1975), Young and Levidow (1981), Harding (1983,1986), Hartsock (1983', b), \nH.moann (1981), O'Brien (1981), Chodorow (1978), J.ggnr (1983). \n",

The stream drawing from Simone de Beauvoir's formulations, \nespecially work by Monique Wittig, Monique Plaza, Colette Guillaumin, and Christine \nDelphy, published in QuestionsJemitiistes, Nouvelles questionsfoninisles, and Feminist Issues, \nand the stream associated complexly with the group 'Psychanalyse et Politique' andlor \nwith Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Sarah Kofman, and Helene Cixous have been \nparticularly influential in international feminist development on issues of se~Llal \ndifference.

These streams deserve large, separnte treannents; but \nin the context of this entry two contributions to theories of 'gender' from these writers, \nwho are deeply opposed among themselves on precisely these issues, must be signalled, \nFirst, there are Wittig's and Delphy's arguments for a materialist feminism, which insist \nthat the issue is 'domination', not 'difference'. Second, there are Irigaray's, Kristeva's, \nand Cixous's various ways (intertextually positioned in relation to Derrida, Lacan and \nothers) of insisting that the subject, which is perhaps best approached through writing \nand texruaiity, is always in process, always disrupted, that the idea of woman remains \nfinally unclosed and multiple.

Latour is not otherwise a notable feminist theorist, but he might be made \ninto one by readings as perverse as those he makes of the laboratory, that great machine \nfor making significant mistakes faster than anyone else can, and so gaining world-\nchanging power. The laboratory for Latour is the railroad industry of epistemology, \nwhere facts can only be made to run on the tracks laid down from the laboratory our. \nThose who control the railroads control the surrounding territory. How could we have \nforgotten? But now it's not so much the bankrupt railroads we need as the satellite \nnetwork. Facts run on lightbeams these days. \n3 \nFor an elegant and very helpful elucidation of a non-Cartoon version of this argument, \nsee White (1987).

The \nRomantic and modernist narural-technical objects of knowledge, in science and in other \ncultural practice, stand on one side of this divide. The postmodernist fonnation stands \non the other side, with its 'anti-aesthetic' of pennanendy split, problematized, always \nreceding and deferred 'objects' of knowledge and practice, including signs, organisms, \nsystems, selves, and cultures. 'Objectivity' in a postmodern frame cannot be about \nunproblematic objects; it must be about specific prosthesis and translation. Objectivity, \nwhich at root has been about crafting comparative knowledge (how to name things to be \nstable and to be like each orner), becomes a question of the politics of redrawing of \nboundaries in order to have non-innocent conversations and connections.

My essay was revised in dialogue with Sofoulis's arguments and metaphors \nin her PhD dissertation. \nCrucial to this discussion are Harding (1986), Keller (1985), Hartsock (1983a, 1983b), \nFlax (1983,1987), Keller and Grontkowski (1983), H. Rose (1986), Haraway (1985; this \nvol. pp. 149-81), and Petchesky (1987). \njohn Varley's science fiction short story called 'The Persistence of Vision' is part of the \ninspiration for this section. In the story, Varley constructs a utopian community designed \nand built by the deaf-blind. He then explores these people's technologies and orner \nmediations of communication and their relations to sighted children and visitors (Varley. \n1978). In 'Blue Champagne', Varley (1986) transmutes the theme to interrogate the \npolitics of intimacy and technology for a paraplegic young woman whose prosthetic \ndevice, the golden gypsy, allows her full mobility. But since the infinitely costly device is \nowned by an intergalactic communications and entertainment empire for which she \nworks as a media star making 'feelies', she may keep her technological, intimate, \nenabling, other self only in exchange for her complicity in the commodification of all \nexperience. What are her limits to the reinvention of experience for sale? Is the personal \npolitical under the sign of simulation? One way to read Varley's repeated investigations \nof finally always limited embodiments, differently abled beings, prosthetic technologies, \nand cyborgian encounters with their finitude despite their extraordinary transcendence \nof 'organic' orders is to find an allegory for the personal and political in the historical \nmythic time of the late twentieth century, the era of techno-biopolitics.

But once undersmod in their constitutive power - once it is understood, that is, \nthat these differences not only constitute each woman's consciousness and subjective \nlimits but all together define the female subject of feminism in its very specificity, its \ninherent and at least for now irreconcilable contradiction - these differences, then, \ncannot be again collapsed into a fixed identity, a sameness of all women as Woman, \nor a representation of Feminism as a coherent and available image. \nHarding (1986, p. 18) suggested that gender has three dimensions, each historically \nspecific: gender symbolism, the social-sexual division of labour, and processes of \nconstructing individual gendered identity. I would enlarge her point to note that there is \nno reason to expect the three dimensions to co-vary or co-detennine each orner, at least \nnot directly. That is, extremely steep gradients between contrasting tenns in gender \nsymbolism may very well not correlate with sharp social-sexual divisions of labour or \nsocial power, but may be closely related to sharp racial stratification or something else. \nSimilarly, the processes of gendered subject fonnation may not be directly illuminated \nby knowledge of the sexual division of labour or the gender symbolism in the particular \nhistorical situation under examination.

The mediations might move through quite different \nsocial axes of organization of both symbols, practice, and identity, such as race. And vice \nversa. I would suggest also that science, as well as gender or race, might usefully be \nbroken up into such a multi-pan scheme of symbolism, social practice, and subject \nposition. More than three dimensions suggest themselves when the parallels are drawn. \nThe different dimensions of, for example, gender, race, and science might mediate \nrelations among dimensions on a parallel chart.

Research and writing for this project were supported by the Alpha Fund and the \nInstitute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ; Academic Senate Faculty Research Grants \nof the University of California Santa Cruz; and the Silicon Valley Research Project, \nUCSC. Crystal Gray was an excellent research assistant. Benefiting from many people's \ncomments, this paper was first presented at the Wenner Gren Foundation's Conference \non Medical Anthropology, Lisbon, Portugal, 5-13 March 1988. \n:z \nEven without taking much account of questions of consciousness and culture, the \nextensive importance of immunological discourse and artefacts has many diagnostic \nsigns: (I) The first Nobel Prize in medicine in 1901 was given for an originary \ndevelopment, namely, the use of diphtheria anti-toxin. With many intervening awards, \nthe pace of Nobel awards in immunology since 1970 is stunning, covering work on the \ngeneration of antibody diversity, the histocompatibility system, monoclonal antibodies \nand hybridomas, the network hypothesis of immune regulation, and development of the \nradioimmunoassay system. (2) The products and processes of immunology enter into \npresent and projected medical, pharmaceutical, and other industrial practices. This \nsituation is exemplified by monoclonal antibodies, which can be used as extremely \nspecific tools to identify, isolate, and manipulate components of production at a \nmolecular scale and then gear up to an industrial scale with unheard-of specificity and \npurity, for a wide array of enterprises - from food flavouring technology, to design and \nmanufacture of industrial chemicals, to delivery systems in chemotherapy {see figure on \n'Applications of monoclonal antibodies in immunology and related disciplines', Nicho-\nlas, 1985, p. 12}. The Rt:u(Jrch Briq,ngs for 1983 for the federal Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy and various other federal departtnents and agencies identified \nimmunology, along with artificial intelligence and cognitive science, solid earth sciences, \ncomputer design and manufacture, and regions of chemistry, as research areas 'that \nwere likely to return the highest scientific dividends as a result of incremental federal \ninvesnnent' (Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, 1983). The divi-\ndends in such fields are hardly expected to be simply 'scientific'. 'In these tenns the major \nmoney spinner undoubtedly is hybridoma technology, and its chief product the mono-\nclonal antibody' (Nicholas, 1985, Preface). {J} The field ofimmunology is itself an inter-\national growth industry. The First International Congress of Immunology was held in \n1971 in Washington, DC, attended by most of the world's leading researchers in the \nfield, abom 3500 people from 45 countries. Over 8000 people attended the Fourth \nInterational Congress in 1980 (Klein, 1982, p. 623). The number ofjoumals in the field \nhas been expanding since 1970 from around twelve to over eighty by 1984. The total of \nbooks and monographs on the subject reached well over 1000 by 1980. The \nindustrial-university collaborations characteristic of the new biotechnology pervade \nresearch arrangements in immunology, as in molecular biology, with which it cross-\nreacts extenSively, for example, the Basel Institute for Immunology, entirely financed by \nHoffman-La Roche but featuring all the benefits of academic practice, including \npublishing freedoms. The International Union of Immunological Societies began in \n1969 with ten national societies, increased to thirty~three by 1984 (Nicholas, 1985). \nImmunology will be at the heart of global biotechnological inequality and 'technology \ntransfer' struggles. Its importance approaches that ofinformation teChnologies in global \nscience politics.

Discourse on infectious AIDS is part of mechanisms that detennine what counts \nas 'the general population', such that over a million infected people in the US alone, not \nto mention the global dimensions ofinfection, can be named in terms that make them not \npart of the general population, with important national medical, insurance, and legal \npolicy implications. Many leading tell.1books of immunology in the United States give \nconsiderably more space to allergies or auto-immune diseases than to parasitic diseases, \nan anocation that might lead future Nobel Prize-winners into some areas of research \nrather than others and that certainly does nothing to lead undergraduates or medical \nstudents to take responsibility for the differences and inequalities of sickness globally. \n(Contrast Golub [19871 with Desowitz [19871 for the sensitivities of a cellular \nimmunology researcher and a parasitologist.) Who counts as an individual is not \nunrelated to who counts us the general population. \nLike the universe inhabited by readers and writer of this essay. \nThis ontological continuity enables the discussion of the growing practical problem of \n'virus' programs infecting computer software (McLellan, 1988). The infective, invading \ninfonnation fragments that parasitize their host code in favour of their own replication \nand their own program commands are more than metaphorically like biological viruses. \nAnd like the body's unwelcome invaders, the software viruses are discussed in tenns of \npathology as communications terrorism, requiring therapy in the fonn of strategic \nsecurity measures. There is a kind of epidemiology of virus infections of artificial \nintelligence systems, and neither the large corporate or military systems nor the personal \ncomputers have good immune defences. Both are extremely vulnerable to terrorism and \nrapid proliferation of the foreign code that multiplies silendy and subverts their normal \nfunctions.

With the discovery of receptors and products shared by cells of the \nneural, endocrine, and immune systems, positing the dispersed and networking immune \nsystem as the mediator between mind and body began to make sense to 'hard' scientists. \nThe implications for popular and official therapeutics are legion, for example, in relation \nto the polysemic entity called 'stress'. See Barnes (1986, 1987); Wechsler (1987); \nKanigel (1986). The biological metaphors invoked to name the immune system also \nfacilitate or inhibit notions of the IS as a potent mediator, rather than a mllSter control \nsystem or hyper~anned defence department. For example, developmental biologist and \nimmunologist, Scott Gilbert, refers in his teaching to the immune system as an \necosystem and neuroimmunology researcher, Edwin Blalock, calls the immune system a \nsensory organ.

They can also have multiple effects in research \ndesign, as well as teaching and therapeutics. \nWhen I begin to think I am paranoid for thinking anyone really dreams of transcendent \ndisembodiment IlS the telos oflife and mind, I find such things as the following quote by \nthe computer designer W. Daniel Hillis in the Wimer 1988 issue of Daedalus on artificial \nintelligence: \nOf course, J understand that this is just a dream, and I will admit that I am propelled \nmore by hope than by the probability of success. But if this artificial mind can sustain \nitself and grow of its own accord, then for the first time human thought will live free \nof bones and flesh, giving this child of mind an earthly immortality denied to us. \n(Hillis, '988, p. ,89) \nThanks to Evelyn Keller for pointing me to the quote. Sce her 'From secrets of life, \nsecrets of death', (1990). I am indebted to Zoe Sofia (1984; Sofoulis, 1988) for analysis \nof the iconography and mythology of nuclear extenninism, extra-terrestrialism, and \ncannibalism. \nThat, of course, is why women have had so much tro~ble counting as individuals in \nmodern Western discourses. Their personal, bounded individuality is compromised by \ntheir bodies' troubling talent for making other bodies, whose individuality can take \nprecedence over their own, even while the little bodies are fully contained and invisible \nwithout major optical technologics (Petchesky, J987). Women can, in a sense, be cut in \nhalf and retain their maternal function - witness their bodies maintained after death to \nsustain the life of another individual. The special ambiguity of female individuality -\nperhaps more resistant, finally, than worms to full liberal personhood - extends into \naccounts of immune function during pregnancy. The old biomedical Question hus been, \nwhy does the mother not reject the little invader within as foreign? Mter all, the embryo \nand foetus are quite wen marked us 'other' by all the ordinary immunological criteria; \nand there is intimate contact between foetal and maternal tissue at the site of certain cells \nof the placenta, called trophoblasts. Counter-inruitively, it turns out that it is women \nwith 'underactive immune systems' who end up rejecting their foetuses immunologically \nby forming antibodies against their tissues. Normally, women make special antibodies \nthat musk the tell-tale foreign signals on the foetal trophoblasts, so that the mother's \nimmune surveillance system remains blind to the foetus's presence. By immunizing the \n'rejecting' women with cells taken from their 'husbands' or other genetically unrelated \ndonors, the woinen's immune systems can be induced to make blocking antibodies. It \nappears that most women are induced to make this sort of annbody as a result of \n'immunization' from their 'husband's' sperm during intercourse. But if the 'husband' is \ntoo genetically close to the potential mother, Some women won't recognize the spenn as \nforeign, and their immune systems won't make blocking antibodies. So the baby gets \nrecognized as foreign. But even this hostile act doesn't make the female a good \ninvidivual, since it resulted from her failure to respond properly to the original breach of \nher boundaries in intercourse (Kalata, 1988a, b). It seems pretty clear that the \nbiopolitical discourses of individuation have their limits for feminist purposes! \nJerne's debt to Chomsky's structuralism is obvious, as are the difficulties that pertain to \nany such version of structuralist internal totality. My argument is that there is more to \nsee here than a too rapid criticism would allow. Jeme's and Chomsky's internal image of \neach other does not constitute the first time theories of the living animal and of language \nhave occupied the same epistemic terrain. See Foucault, The Order of Things (197o). \nRemember that Foucault in Archaeology o/Know/edge defined discourses as 'practices that \n",

The family \nrelation between structuralism and rationalism is something I will avoid for now. \nEmily Martin has begun a three-year fieldwork project on networks of immunological \ndiscourse in laboratories, the media, and among people wim and without AIDS. \nMice and 'men' are constantly associated in immune discourse because these sibling \nanimal bodies have been best characterized in the immunological laboratory. For \nexample, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a complex of genes that \nencodes a critical array of surface markers involved in almost all of the key immune \nresponse recognition events, is well characterized for each species. The complex is \ncalled the H2 locus in me mouse and the HLA locus in humans. The MHC codes for \nwhat wiD be recognized as 'self. The locus is criticalJy involved in 'restriction' of \nspecificities. Highly polygenic and polyallelic, the MHC may be the main system \nallowing discrimination between self and non-self. 'Non-self must be presented to an \nimmune system cell 'in me context of self; that is, associated with the surface markers \ncoded by the ¥HC. Comparative studies of the antigens of the MHC with the \nmolecular structures of other key actors in the immune response (antibodies, T cell \ndifferentiation antigens) have led to lhe concept of the 'immunoglobulin superfamily', \ncharacterized by its extensive sequence homologies that suggest an evolutionary \nelaboration from a common genic ancestor (Golub, Ig87, pp. 202-33). The conceptual \nand laboratory tools developed to construct knowledge of the MHC are a microcosm for \nunderstanding the apparatus of production of the bodies of the immune system. Various \nantigens coded by the MHC confer 'public' or 'private' specificities, terms which \ndesignate degrees of shared versus differentiating antigens against a background of dose \ngenetic similarity, but not identity. Immunology could be approached as the science \nconstructing such language-like 'distinguishing features' of the organic communications \nsystem. Current research on 'tolerance' and the ways thymic cells (T cells) 'educate' \nother cells about what is and is not 'selr led the biologist, Scott Gilben, to ask if that is \nimmunology's equivalent of the injunction to know 'thy*self' (personal communication). \nReading immunologicnllanguage requires both extreme literal-mindedness and a taste \nfor troping. jennifer Terry examined AIDS as a 'trop(olog)icnl pandemic' (unpublished \npaper, uesC). \nIt is not just imagers of the immune system who learn from military cultures; military \ncultures draw symbiotically on immune system discourse, just as strategic planners draw \ndirectly from and contribute [0 video game practices and science fiction. For example, in \nMililary Rt!Viav Colonel Frederick Timmerman argued for an elite corps of special strike \nforce soldiers in the army of the future in mese teons: \nThe most appropriate example to describe how lhis system would work is the most \ncomplex biological model we know - the body's immune system. Within the body \nthere exists a remarkably complex corps of internal bodyguards. In absolute numbers \nthey are small - only about one percent of the body's cells. Yet they consist of \nreconnaissance specialists, killers, reconstitution specialists, and communicators that \ncan seek out invaders, sound the alarm, reproduce rapidly, and swann to the attack to \nrepel the enemy ... In this regard, the june Ig86 issue of National Geographic \ncontains a detailed account of how the body's immune system functions. (Timmer-\nman, Ig87, p. 52) \n",

Sexual practices \nhad little need of secrecy; words were said without undue \nreticence, and things were done without too much conceal- \nment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit. Codes \nregulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were \nquite lax compared to those of the nineteenth century. It was \na time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open \ntransgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermin- \ngled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the \nlaughter of adults: it was a period when bodies \"made a \ndisplay of themselves.\" \nBut twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the \nmonotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie. Sexuality \nwas carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal \nfamily took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious \nfunction of reproduction. On the subject of sex, silence be- \ncame the rule. The legitimate and procreative couple laid \ndown the law. The couple imposed itself as model, enforced \nthe norm, safeguarded the truth, and reserved the right to \nspeak while retaining the principle of secrecy. A single locus \nof sexuality was acknowledged in social space as well as at \nthe heart of every household, but it was a utilitarian and \nfertile one: the parents' bedroom. The rest had only to re- \nmain vague; proper demeanor avoided contact with other \nbodies, and verbal decency sanitized one's speech. And ster- \n3 \n",

Nor \ndid it merit a hearing. It would be driven out, denied, and \nreduced to silence. Not only did it not exist, it had no right \nto exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani- \nfestation-whether \nin acts or in words. Everyone knew, for \nexample, that children had no sex, which was why they were \nforbidden to talk about it, why one closed one's eyes and \nstopped one's ears whenever they came to show evidence to \nthe contrary, and why a general and studied silence was \nimposed. These are the characteristic features attributed to \nrepression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi- \ntions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen- \ntence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an \naffirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis- \nsion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing \ntosee, and nothing to know. Such was the hypocrisy of our \nbourgeois societies with its halting logic. It was forced to \nmake a few concessions, however.

We \nare informed that if repression has indeed been the funda- \nmental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since \nthe classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able \nto free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: noth- \ning less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, \nan irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within real- \nity, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power \nwill be required. For the least glimmer of truth is conditioned \nby politics. Hence, one cannot hope to obtain the desired \nresults simply from a medical practice, nor from a theoretical \ndiscourse, however rigorously pursued. Thus, one denounces \nFreud's conformism, the normalizing functions of psychoa- \nnalysis, the obvious timidity underlying Reich's vehemence, \nand all the effects of integration ensured by the \"science\" of \nsex and the barely equivocal practices of sexology. \nThis discourse on modern sexual repression holds up well, \nowing no doubt to how easy it is to uphold. A solemn histori- \ncal and political guarantee protects it. By placing the advent \nof the age of repression in the seventeenth century, after \nhundreds of years of open spaces and free expression, one \nadjusts it to coincide with the development of capitalism: it \nbecomes an integral part of the bourgeois order.

Sex and its effects \nare perhaps not so easily deciphered; on the other hand, their \nrepression, thus reconstructed, is easily analyzed. And the \nsexual cause-the \ndemand for sexual freedom, but also for \nthe knowledge to be gained from sex and the right to speak \nabout it-becomes \nlegitimately associated with the honor of \na political cause: sex too is placed on the agenda for the \nfuture. A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many \nprecautions in order to give the history of sex such an impres- \nsive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness: \nas if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such \na discourse could be formulated or accepted. \nBut there may be another reason that makes it so gratify- \ning for us to define the relationship between sex and power \nin terms of repression: something that one might call the \nspeaker's benefit. If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to \nprohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact \nthat one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliber- \nate transgression. A person who holds forth in such language \nplaces himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power; \nhe upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the com- \ning freedom. This explains the solemnity with which one \nspeaks of sex nowadays. When they had to allude to it, the \nfirst demographers and psychiatrists of the nineteenth cen- \ntury thought it advisable to excuse themselves for asking \ntheir readers to dwell on matters so trivial and base. But for \ndecades now, we have found it difficult to speak on the \nsubject without striking a different pose: we are conscious of \ndefying established power, our tone of voice shows that we \nknow we are being subversive, and we ardently conjure away \nthe present and appeal to the future, whose day will be \n",

Tomorrow sex will be good \nagain. \n- - Because this repression is affirmed, one can discreetly \nbring into coexistence concepts which the fear of ridicule or \nthe bitterness of history prevents most of us from putting side \nby side: revolution and happiness; or revolution and a differ- \nent body, one that is newer and more beautiful; or indeed, \nrevolution and pleasure. What sustains our eagerness to \nspeak of sex in terms of repression is doubtless this opportu- \nnity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths \nand promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation, \nand manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that com- \nbines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change \nthe laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights. \nThis is perhaps what also explains the market value at- \ntributed not only to what is said about sexual repression, but \nalso to the mere fact of lending an ear to those who would \neliminate the effects of repression, Ours is, after all, the only \ncivilization in which officials are paid to listen to all and \nsundry impart the secrets of their sex: as if the urge to talk \nabout it, and the interest one hopes to arouse by doing so, \nhave far surpassed the possibilities of being heard, so that \nsome individuals have even offered their ears for hire. \nBut it appears to me that the essential thing is not this \neconomic factor, but rather the existence in our era of a \ndiscourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturn- \ning of global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come, \nand the promise of a certain felicity are linked together. \nToday it is sex that semes as a support for the ancient form \n-so \nfamiliar and important in the West-of \npreaching.

The affirmation of a sexuality that has never \nbeen more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the \nhypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled \nwith the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal \nthe truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, sub- \nvert the law that governs it, and change its future.

Is what first \ncomes into view-and \nconsequently permits one to advance \nan initial hypothesis-really \nthe accentuation or even the \nestablishment of a regime of sexual repression beginning in \nthe seventeenth century? This is a properly historical ques- \ntion. Second doubt: Do the workings of power, and in partic- \nular those mechanisms that are brought into play in societies \nsuch as ours, really belong primarily to the category of re- \npression? Are prohibition, censorship, and denial truly the \nforms through which power is exercised in a general way, if \nnot in every society, most certainly in our own? This is a \nhistorico-theoretical question. A third and final doubt: Did \nthe critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come \nto act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had ope- \nrated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part \nof the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and \ndoubtless misrepresents) by calling it \"repression\"? Was \nthere really a historical rupture between the age of repression \nand the critical analysis of repression? This is a historico- \npolitical question. My purpose in introducing these three \ndoubts is not merely to construct counterarguments that are \nsymmetrical and contrary to those outlined above; it is not \na matter of saying that sexuality, far from being repressed in \ncapitalist and bourgeois societies, has on the contrary benefit- \nted from a regime of unchanging liberty; nor is it a matter \nof saying that power in societies such as ours is more tolerant \nthan repressive, and that the critique of repression, while it \nmay give itself airs of a rupture with the past, actually forms \npart of a much older process and, depending on how one \n",

Why has \nsexuality been so widely discussed, and what has been said \nabout it? What were the effects of power generated by what \nwas said? What are the links between these discourses, these \neffects of power, and the pleasures that were invested by \nthem? What knowledge (savoir) was formed as a result of this \nlinkage? The object, in short, is to define the regime of power- \nknowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human \nsexuality in our part of the world. The central issue, then (at \nleast in the first instance), is not to determine whether one \nsays yes or no to sex, whether one formulates prohibitions or \npermissions, whether one asserts its importance or denies its \neffects, or whether one refines the words one uses to designate \nit; but to account for the fact that it is spoken about, to \ndiscover who does the speaking, the positions and viewpoints \nfrom which they speak, the institutions which prompt people \nto speak about it and which store and distribute the things \nthat are said.

Around the schoolboy and \nhis sex there proliferated a whole literature of precepts, opin- \nions, observations, medical advice, clinical cases, outlines for \nreform, and plans for ideal institutions.

On the surface, what appears in both cases is an \neffort at elimination that was always destined to fail and \nalways constrained to begin again.

In the erotic \nart, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a \npractice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not con- \nsidered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and \nthe forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but \nfirst and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as \npleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific qual- \nity, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul. \nMoreover, this knowledge must be deflected back into the \nsexual practice itself, in order to shape it as though from \nwithin and amplify its effects. In this way, there is formed a \nknowledge that must remain secret, not because of an ele- \nment of infamy that might attach to its object, but because \nof the need to hold it in the greatest reserve, since, according \nto tradition, it would lose its effectiveness and its virtue by \nbeing divulged. Consequently, the relationship to the master \nwho holds the secrets is of paramount importance; only he, \nworking alone, can transmit this art in an esoteric manner \nand as the culmination of an initiation in which he guides the \ndisciple's progress with unfailing skill and se;rity. \nThe \n",

The slogan of this re- \ngime, pax etjustitia, in keeping with the function it laid claim \nto, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private \nwars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling \nof lawsuits. Doubtless there was more to this development of \ngreat monarchic institutions than a pure and simple juridical \nedifice. But such was the language of power, the representa- \ntion it gave of itself, and the entire theory of public law that \nwas constructed in the Middle Ages, or reconstructed from \nRoman law, bears witness to the fact. Law was not simply \na weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the mo- \nnarchic system's mode of manifestation and the form of its \nacceptability. In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the \nexercise of power has always been formulated in terms of \nlaw. \nA tradition dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth \ncentury has accustomed us to place absolute monarchic \npower on the side of the unlawful: arbitrariness, abuse, ca- \nprice, willfulness, privileges and exceptions, the traditional \ncontinuance of accomplished facts. But this is to overlook a \nfundamental historical trait of Western monarchies: they \nwere constructed as systems of law, they expressed them- \nselves through theories of law, and they made their mech- \nanisms of power work in the form of law. The old reproach \nthat Boulainvilliers directed at the French monarchy-that \nit used the law and jurists to do away with rights and to bring \ndown the aristocracy-was \nbasically warranted by the facts. \nThrough the development of the monarchy and its institu- \ntions this juridico-political dimension was established.

But these are not intended as methodological \nimperatives; at most they are cautionary prescriptions. \n1. Rule of immanence \nOne must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of \nsexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and \ndisinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mech- \nanisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or \nideological requirements of power. If sexuality was con- \nstituted as an area of investigation, this was only because \nrelations of power had established it as a possible object; and \nconversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was \nbecause techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis- \ncourse were capable of investing it. Between techniques of \nknowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, \neven if they have specific roles and are linked together on the \nbasis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what \nmight be called \"local centers\" of power-knowledge: for ex- \nample, the relations that obtain between penitents and \nconfessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience. \nHere, guided by the theme of the \"flesh\" that must be mas- \ntered, different forms of discourse-self-examination, \nques- \ntioning~, admissions, interpretations, interviews-were \nthe \nvehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of \nforms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge. Similarly, \nthe body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his \ncradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of \nparents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten- \ntive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted, \nparticularly since the eighteenth century, another \"local cen- \nter\" of power-knowledge. \n",

This deployment of \nalliance, with the mechanisms of constraint that ensured its \nexistence and the complex knowledge it often required, lost \nsome of its importance as economic processes and political \nstructures could no longer rely on it as an adequate instru- \nment or sufficient support. Particularly from the eighteenth \ncentury onward, Western societies created and deployed a \nnew apparatus which was superimposed on the previous one, \nand which, without completely supplanting the latter, helped \nto reduce its importance. I am speaking of the deployment of \nsexuality: like the deployment of alliance, it connects up with \nthe circuit of sexual partners, but in a completely different \nway. The two systems can be contrasted term by term. The \ndeployment of alliance is built around a system of rules \ndefining the permitted and the forbidden, the licit and the \nillicit, whereas the deployment of sexuality operates accord- \ning to mobile, polymorphous, and contingent techniques of \npower. The deployment of alliance has as one of its chief \nobjectives to reproduce the interplay of relations and main- \ntain the law that governs them; the deployment of sexuality, \non the other hand, engenders a continual extension of areas \nand forms of control. For the first, what is pertinent is the \nlink between partners and definite statutes; the second is \nconcerned with the sensations of the body, the quality of \npleasures, and the nature of impressions, however tenuous or \nimperceptible these may be.

The second, a \ntwentieth-century phenomenon, was really less a rupture \nthan an inflexion of the curve: this was the moment when the \nmechanisms of repression were seen as beginning to loosen \ntheir grip; one passed from insistent sexual taboos to a rela- \ntive tolerance with regard to prenuptial or extramarital rela- \ntions; the disqualification of \"perverts\" diminished, their \n' condemnation by the law was in part eliminated; a good \nmany of the taboos that weighed on the sexuality of children \nwere lifted. \nWe must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices: \nthe inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renova- \ntions of previous techniques.

The right \nwhich was fornlulated as the \"power of life and death\" was \nin reality the right to toke life or let live. Its symbol, after \nall, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re- \nferred to a historical type of society in which power was \nexercised mainly as a means of deduction (prkZ2vement), a \nsubtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of \nthe wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and \nblood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was \nessentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and \nultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize \nhold of life in order to suppress it. \nSince the classical age the West has undergone a very \nprofound transformation of these mechanisms of power. \n\"Deduction\" has tended to be no longer the major form of \npower but merely one element among others, working to \nincite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize \nthe forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak- \ning them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated \nto impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. \nThere has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least \na tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis- \ntering power and to define itself accordingly.

Through a reversal \nthat doubtless had its surreptitious beginnings long ago-it \n.was already making itself felt at the time of the Christian \npastoral of the flesh-we \nhave arrived at the point where we \nexpect our intelligibility to come from what was for many \ncenturies thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body \nfrom what was long considered its stigma and likened to a \nwound; our identity from what was perceived as an obscure \nand nameless urge. Hence the importance we ascribe to it, \nthe reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we \ntake to know it. Hence the fact that over the centuries it has \nbecome more important than our soul, more important al- \nmost than our life; and so it is that all the world's enigmas \nappear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in \neach of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than \nany other. The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been \ninstilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as \nfollows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the \ntruth and the sovereignty of sex. Sex is worth dying for. It \nis in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued \nwith the death instinct. When a long while ago the West \ndiscovered love, it bestowed on it a value high enough to \nmake death acceptable; nowadays it is sex that claims this \nequivalence, the highest of all. And while the deployment of \nsexuality permits the techniques of power to invest life, the \nfictitious point of sex, itself marked by that deployment, \nexerts enough charm on everyone for them to accept hearing \nthe grumble of death within it. \nBy creating the imaginary element that is \"sex,\" the de- \nployment of sexuality established one of its most essential \ninternal operating principles: the desire for sex-the \ndesire to \nhave it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to \narticulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth. It con- \nstituted \"sex\" itself as something desirable. And it is this \n",

We must not place sex on the side of reality, and \nsexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is \na very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the \nnotion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its opera- \ntion. We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says \nno to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid \nout by the general deployment of sexuality. It is the agency \nof sex that we must break away from, if we aim-through \na \ntactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality-to \ncounter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleas- \nures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibil- \nity of resistance. The rallying point for the counterattack \nagainst the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex- \ndesire, but bodies and pleasures. \n\"There has been so much action in the past,\" said D. H. \nLawrence, \"especially sexual action, a wearying repetition \nover and over, without a corresponding thought, a corre- \nsponding realization. Now our business is to realize sex. \nToday the full conscious realization of sex is even more \nimportant than the act itself.\" \nPerhaps one day people will wonder at this. They will not \nbe able to understand how a civilization so intent on develop- \ning enormous instruments of production and destruction \n",

And \npeople will ask themselves why we were so bent on ending \nthe rule of silence regarding what was the noisiest of our \npreoccupations. In retrospect, this noise may appear to have \nbeen out of place, but how much stranger will seem our \npersistence in interpreting it as but the refusal to speak and \nthe order to remain silent. People will wonder what could \nhave made i s  so presumptuous; they will look for the reasons \nthat might explain why we prided ourselves on being the first \nto grant sex the importance we say is its due and how we \ncame to congratulate ourselves for finally-in \nthe twentieth \ncentury-having \nbroken free of a long period of harsh repres- \nsion, a protracted Christian asceticism, greedily and fastidi- \nously adapted to the imperatives of bourgeois economy. And \nwhat we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and \nthe difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the \ncenturies-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling \nsex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon \nsex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when \nin fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality. \nPeople will be amused at the reproach of pansexualism \nthat was once aimed at Freud and psychoanalysis. But the \nones who will appear to have been blind will perhaps be not \nso much those who formulated the objection as those who \ndiscounted it out of hand, as if it merely expressed the fears \nof an outmoded prudishness.

But the others were mistaken concerning the na- \nture of the process; they believed that Freud had at last, \nthrough a sudden reversal, restored to sex the rightful share \nwhich it had been denied for so long; they had not seen how \nthe good genius of Freud had placed it at one of the critical \npoints marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the \nstrategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effec- \ntive he was-worthy \nof the greatest spiritual fathers and \ndirectors of the classical period-in \ngiving a new impetus to \nthe secular injunction to study sex and transform it into \ndiscourse. We are often reminded of the countless procedures \nwhich Christianity once employed to make us detest the \nbody; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for \ncenturies to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it \ndesirable and everything said about it precious.

These \ndevices are what ought to make us wonder today. Moreover, \nwe need to consider the possibility that one day, perhaps, in \na different economy of bodies and pleasures, people will no \nlonger quite understand how the ruses of sexuality, and the \npower that sustains its organization, were able to subject us \nto that austere monarchy of sex, so that we became dedicated \nto the endless task of forcing its secret, of exacting the truest \nof confessions from a shadow. \nThe irony of this deployment is in having us believe that \nour \"liberation\" is in the balance. \n",

    "chunk_full": "Foreword \nCHANGING THE POINT OF VIEW \nIf a single name has been associated with the French Women's \nLiberation Movement, it is surely that of Monique Wittig. Her \nreputation is largely due to her literary works, which have been \ntranslated into several languages. But if Monique Wittig has \nmade her mark as a writer in this second half of the twentieth \ncentury, the spreading of her theoretical texts will also show her \nto be one of tlie great thinkers of our time. \nIt is impossible to locate Wittig's influence entirely in litera-\nture, politics, or theory, for her work in fact traverses all three, \nand it is precisely from this multidimensionality that the great \nimportance of her thought derives. \nMuch has been written about her literary works, yet not \nenough has been said of her theoretical and political writings. \nThis will be a more political testimony, then, for I have been very \nfortunate in knowing Monique Wittig personally since the early \n1970s. While it is possible to articulate the immediate influence \nof Wittig's thinking, it is still quite difficult to anticipate the full \n· influence her work will have on the history of women's struggle \nfor liberation. Her essays call into question some of the basic \n\"premises· of contemporary feminist theory. What is at issue here \nis a total conceptual revolution. \nTRANSLATED BY MARLENE WILDEMAN \n",

When this essay was published two \nyears later in the French journal Questions feministes, this \nstunned silence had been transformed -\nby some of the more \nradical feminists -\ninto political pressure; a note had been \nadded to \"soften\" the conclusion. Wittig's startling point of view \nwas unimaginable at that time. In point of fact, a page had been \nturned in the history of the Women's Liberation Movement by \none of France's principal instigators. What exactly was this \npage? Why was it no longer possible to see the Women's Lib-\neration Movement in exactly the same way? Precisely because \nthe point of view had shifted. \nSince the beginning of this century, the entire women's strug-\ngle, from the defense of \"women's rights\" to a feminist analysis \nof \"women's oppression,\" has taken as its foundation \"the point \nof view of women.\" That went without saying. This analysis was \nrefined over the years and different tendencies emerged, as hap-\npens in all liberation movements, but never was this basic con-\nsensus called into question. It seemed, in any case, indisputable. \nAnd so it was that the statement \"lesbians are not women\" \nwould, at one and the same time, theoretically and politically \ndisrupt an entire movement. \nFounded upon the latest concepts of materialist and radical \nfeminism,\" among them the idea of \"classes of sex,\" Wittig's state-\nment called into question a fundamental point feminism had \nnever disputed: heterosexuality.

But the categories \nthemselves, \"man\" and \"woman,\" had not actually been ques-\ntioned. Here is where \"lesbian existence\" takes on its particular \nmeaning, for if these two categories cannot exist without each \nother, and lesbians exist by and for \"women\" only, there has to \nbe a flaw in this conceptual system. \nIn the early 1980s, many lesbians in France and Quebec began \ncalling this point of view \"radical lesbianism\" and totally revised \ntheir strategy. Radical lesbians have now reached a basic con-\nsensus that views heterosexuality as a political regime which \nmust be overthrown, and we all draw inspiration from the writ-\nings of Monique Wittig. For us, Wittig's body of work consti-\ntuted a point of departure for analysis and action. All of history \nwas to be reexamined. \nWhen history is reexamined from this point of view, it is in-\nteresting to note that the groundwork of a critique of hetero-\nsexuality as a \"political institution\" had already been laid at the \nbeginning of the 1970s by certain lesbian separatists in the \nUnited States.1 But American lesbian separatism did not take up \nthis analysis. Rather its aim was to develop within an essentialist \nframework new lesbian values within lesbian communities. This \nwas, and still is, to ignore that \"heterosexuality ... can ensure \nits political power only through the destruction or the negation \nof lesbianism.\"2 The existence of lesbian communities is strate-\ngically necessary. But if they are not within the context of a po-\nlitical movement that aims to abolish the heterosexual system, \ntheir significance is entirely different; it is a matter then of cre-\nating a \"new category.\" But only the destruction of the existing \ncategories can bring about real change.

This key sentence \nprovides the political dimension of the lesbian point of view. \nWhen reading Wittig, it must always be borne in mind. \nIn the United States, Adrienne Rich put forward a feminist \nanalysis of heterosexuality in her 1980 essay \"Compulsory Het-\nerosexuality and Lesbian Existence.\"3 For Rich, heterosexuality \nis \"something that has to be imposed, managed, organized, pro-\npagandized and maintained by force.\"4 This text poses hetero-\nsexuality as a political institution in the patriarchal system. Rich \nsees lesbian existence as an act of resistance to this institution, \nbut for \"lesbian existence to realize this political content in an--\nultimately liberating form, the erotic choice must depend and \nexpand into conscious woman-identification.\"5 Rich analyses the \nconcept of heterosexuality within the framework of contempo-\nrary feminist theory from the \"women's point of view,\" whereas \nradical lesbianism does without that point of view. It sees les-\nbianism as necessarily political and considers it outside the \nwhole heterosexual political regime. For to speak of \"compul-\nsory heterosexuality\" is redundant. \n\"Consciousness of oppression is not only a reaction to [fight \nagainst] oppression. It is also the whole conceptual reevalua-\ntion of the social world, its whole reorganization with new con-\ncepts ... \" (\"One Is Not Born a Woman\").

And it is through her writing \nthat I have also come to understand the necessity of going back \nand forth between the theoretical and the political. Political \nstruggle cannot be conceived without this, and, as theory is grad-\nually transformed, we must also transform our political struggle. \nThis is a challenge that requires constant vigilance and a con-\nstant willingness to reconsider our actions and our political po-\nsitions. It is in this sense that radical lesbians' questioning of the \nfeminist movement must be understood. \n\"We must produce a political transformation of the key con-\ncepts, that is of the concepts which are strategic for us\" (\"The \nStraight Mind\"). By not questioning the heterosexual political \nregime, contemporary feminism proposes rearranging rather \nthan eliminating this system. Likewise, the contemporary devel-\nopment of the notion of \"gender,\" it seems to me, masks, or \ncamouflages, the relationships of oppression. Often \"gender,\" \neven as it attempts to describe the social relations between men \nand women, lets us ignore, or diminish, the notion of \"classes \nof sex,\" thereby divesting these relationships of their political \ndimension. \nI would like to mention here one of the critical elements of \nWittig's body of thought, neatly summarized by the following \nphrase: \"A text by a minority writer is effective only if it succeeds \nin making the minority point of view universal\" (\"The Universal \nand the Particular\"). This exemplifies Wittig's extraordinary ef-\nfectiveness. In claiming the lesbian point of view as universal, \nshe overturns the concepts to which we are accustomed. For up \nto this point, minority writers had to add \"the universal\" to their \npoints of view if they wished to attain the unquestioned univer-\nsality,of the dominant class.

They have shaped our concepts, our \nlaws, our institutions, our history, our cultures\" (\"Homo Sum\"). \nTo reexamine the parameters on which universal thought is \nfounded requires a reevaluation of all the basic tools of analysis, \nincluding dialectics.

But I am only enumerating the people who had a \ndirect influence on my way of thinking. \nThese collected essays are divided in two parts. The first half, \nas I have already mentioned, is a political discussion. With \"Cat-\negory of Sex\" I wanted to show \"sex\" as a political category. \nThe word \"gender\" already used in England and in the United \nStates seemed to me imprecise. In \"One Is Not Born a Woman,\" \nthere is an attempt to establish a link between women fighting \nfor women as a class, against the idea of \"woman\" as an essen-\ntialist concept. In the \"Straight Mind,\" I sketch the thought \nwhich throughout the centuries built heterosexuality as a given. \n\"The Social Contract\" discusses the idea that there is an issue \nbeyond the heterosexual social contract. \"Homo Sum\" is about \npolitical thought and the future of dialectics. \nIn the second half of this collection I mention the object of \nmy main concern: writing. My first book, The Opoponax, was \nsupported by the French New Novel, a school of writers whom \nI will always admire for the way they have revolutionized the \nnovel and for their stand for literature as literature. They have \ntaught me what work is in literature. \nIn \"The Point of View, Universal or Particular\" I touch upon \nthe problem of a work of art in which the literary forms cannot \nbe perceived because the theme of the work (here homosexual-\nity) predominates. \nThe \"Trojan Horse\" is a discussion of language as raw ma-\nterial for the writer and of how violently literary forms affect \ntheir context when they are new. This essay has been developed \nin an unpublished work which I call The Literary Workshop (le \nChantier litteraire). \nPREFACE \nXVI \n",

The first was Questions feministes, whose col-\nlective invited me to join them when I first came to the United \nStates. At that time I worked on the preparation of a series of \nseminars in the French Department at the University of Califor-\nnia, Berkeley. I was trying to inaugurate on my own an episte-\nmological revolution in the approach to the oppression of \nwomen. It was then that I joined with enthusiasm this group \nwhose members were working in the same direction. \nFeminist Issues was begun in Berkeley a few years later to ad-\ndress the concept of feminist materialism, and their collective \ninvited me to be their advisory editor. In spite of the conflict we \nhad in France on the lesbian question, the American editors \n(Mary Jo Lakeland and Susan Ellis Wolf) decided that this ques-\ntion would not injure the journal and that it would receive the \nattention that it deserved in an international framework. \nAmazones d'hier, Lesbiennes d'aujourd'hui was published in \nMontreal by radical lesbians led by Louise Turcotte and Daniele \nCharest who understood both the necessity of a theory of feminist \nmaterialism and the necessity of going beyond it, through the \ntheory and the struggle that they have adopted and developed. \nMonique Wittig \nTucson \nJanuary 1991 \nPREFACE \nXVII \n",

The ideology \nof sexual difference functions as censorship in our culture by \nmasking, on the ground of nature, the social opposition between \nmen and women. Masculine/feminine, male/female are the cat-\negories which serve to conceal the fact that social differences al-\nways belong to an economic, political, ideological order. Every \nsystem of domination establishes divisions at the material and \neconomic level. Furthermore, the divisions are abstracted and \nturned into concepts by the masters, and later on by the slaves \nwhen they rebel and start to struggle. The masters explain and \njustify the established divisions as a result of natural differences. \nThe slaves, when they rebel and start to struggle, read social op-\npositions into the so-called natural differences . \n.-\nFor there is no sex. There is but sex that is oppressed and sex \nthat oppresses. It is oppression that creates sex and not the con-\ntrary. The contrary would be to say that sex creates oppression, \nor to say that the cause (origin) of oppression is to be found in \nsex itself, in a natural division of the sexes preexisting (or outside \nof) society. \nThe primacy of difference so constitutes our thought that it \nprevents turning inward on itself to question itself, no matter \nhow necessary that may be to apprehend the basis of that which \nprecisely constitutes it. To apprehend a difference in dialectical \nterms is to make apparent the contradictory terms to be resolved. \nTo understand social reality in dialectical materialist terms is to \napprehend the oppositions between classes, term to term, and \nmake them meet under the same copula (a conflict in the social \norder), which is also a resolution (an abolition in the social or-\nder) of the apparent contradictions. \nMONIQUE WITTIG \n2 \n",

This, we lesbians, and nonlesbians as well, knew be-\nfore the beginning of the lesbian and feminist movement.

Having stood up to fight \nfor a sexless society, 13 we now find ourselves entrapped in the \nfamiliar deadlock of \"woman is wonderful.\" Simone de Beauvoir \nunderlined particularly the false consciousness which consists of \nselecting among the features of the myth (that women are dif-\nferent from men) those which ·took good and using them as a \ndefinition for women.

In their opinion the \nterm \"social contract,\" which implies a notion of individual \nchoice and of voluntary association, could possibly be applied \nto the serfs. For in the course of several centuries they liberated \nthemselves one by one, running away from the land to which \nthey belonged. And it is also one by one that the serfs associated \nto form cities, hence their name, bourgeois (people who have \nformed a bourg).2 (It seems that as soon as Rousseau developed \nthe idea of the social contract as far as it has ever been devel-\noped, history outdated it -\nbut not before some of his propo-\nsitions were adopted without amendment by the French Revo-\nlutionary Assembly.) \n",

This 'I' can be destroyed in the attempt and resus-\ncitated.
