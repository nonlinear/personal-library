(Um, how dare he\nshare ALL our secrets?!) I hope he’s charging at least a year’s worth of\nschool tuition for this book. Seriously, take copious notes on the practical\nsuggestions offered here to help steer your own career, whether it’s your\nfirst job or your 75th freelance gig. The drama-free work approach and\nleadership style outlined in _Burn Your Portfolio_ is what makes working with\nMike and all the folks at his company, Riser, FUN and worthy of the cupcakes\nwe send to celebrate each of our successes together.”\n\n**—Michelle Sullivan**  \n** _VP Digital, Kids & Family Publishing and Media, National Geographic (aka\n800-pound Gorilla Client)_**\n\n“This book should be a mandatory course at art schools...no, at _all_ schools!\nThe message transcends occupation; it’s about maneuvering through the unspoken\nrules and dynamics of various personalities in your workplace. Mike is a\nperfect person to deliver this message; his long-term relationships and\nsuccess of his business are the true testimony of his skills on managing up,\ndown, and sideways. Your talent alone will take you nowhere if your character\ndoesn’t support it. If you want longevity in your field, this book is a must-\nread.”\n\n**—Jane Bhang**  \n** _Consulting Art Director, Sony Pictures Entertainment_**\n\n“I wish I could take every designer I’ve ever worked with and smack them over\nthe head with this book...which would hurt, because it’s big! After that, I’d\ntell them to read it cover to cover, because Michael Janda will show them how\nto stop making the business mistakes nearly everyone in design is making.”\n\n**—Dave Crenshaw  \n _Author of_ The Myth of Multitasking _and_ The Focused Business**\n\n“ _Burn Your Portfolio_ is an enjoyable, substantive gallop through an\ninventive guidebook for designers and programmers who envision themselves with\na thriving business. It should be on every designer’s must-read list. Michael\ndraws in the reader by “showing” rather than merely “telling.” He gives the\nbook a human, personal touch by sprinkling the text with his own adventures.\nAnd though he is primarily speaking to designers, his message about honing\ninterpersonal skills is imperative for ANY enterprise. As a client, that, more\nthan anything, keeps me coming back.”\n\n**—Cheryl Saban, Ph.D.**  \n**_Author of_** **What Is Your Self-Worth? A Woman’s Guide to Validation**\n**_and founder of the Self Worth Foundation_**\n\n“I went to school to learn to be a designer. I went to Mike Janda to learn to\nrun a design business. He is incredible. I’ve never met anyone who literally\nunderstands everything that I’ve ever struggled with since the day I graduated\nfrom school. From freelancing, contracts, and proposals to making the best\nbusiness decisions and standing up to any kind of client, Janda tells you\neverything you need to know. His life lessons are quick, in layman’s terms,\nand so amazingly valuable you will use something he teaches you every single\nday.”\n\n**—Lorilee Rager**  \n** _Owner, Thrive Creative Group, LLC_**\n\n“Do you want to supercharge your design career? Drop that Wacom pen and\nimmediately pick up _Burn Your Portfolio_ , and read it cover to cover.\nMichael Janda clearly outlines practical, actionable advice that will make\nyour design business better, your clients happier, and your teams more\nproductive. Even if you’re a freelancer just striking out on your own—no,\nespecially if you are—the insights, truisms, and humor in this book will prove\nto be valuable tools in your design arsenal.”\n\n**—Marc Siry**  \n** _SVP, Media Products, NBC Universal_**\n\n“This one’s on fire! _Burn Your Portfolio_ is hands-down the most\nentertaining, helpful, and hilarious insider’s guide for creative\nprofessionals out there. Janda is an absolute genius when it comes to managing\nclient expectations, creating production processes that actually work, and\nrunning a thriving and vibrant design business. He and I used to work together\nat Fox—I owe much of my own success to his brilliant and zany methods.”\n\n**—Allison Ellis**  \n** _Owner, Hopscotch Consulting_**\n\n“Michael Janda is the one person you want to listen to when it comes to advice\nabout succeeding in a creative field! He has more creative talent, street\nsmarts, and people skills than anyone I have ever met. What this book presents\nthe reader with is an inside-track to those secrets in an appetizing\ncollection of goodness!”\n\n**—Jeff Jolley**  \n** _President, Riser_**\n\n“The starving artist cliché has never been in greater danger. _Burn Your\nPortfolio_ gives creative professionals the tools they need to succeed in\ntoday’s competitive marketplace, a marketplace where many relying on talent\nalone have failed. Creatives...READ THIS BOOK!”\n\n**—Mark Long**  \n** _Founder, RetouchUp/Hollywood FotoFix Studios_**\n\n“I’ve worked with Michael and Riser for many years, and the thing that\ndifferentiates Michael and his team from other agencies is their ability to\nspeak my language versus design speak! Michael and his company Riser are not\nonly super-creative, they are total professionals. Communication is a big\nreason why Michael and his team are so successful at what they do. They are\ngood at not only listening to a client who is not a designer and is trying to\nconvey the details of a project, but also on working with the client to get\nthe job done well, on time, and also on budget. I can’t think of a better\nperson to give advice to designers who need to work with clients in the real\nworld.”\n\n**—Melissa Van Meter**  \n** _VP, Marketing & Advertising, TV Guide Network_**\n\n“Wow! Mike Janda has delivered truly invaluable insight and real-world tips on\nhow to be a rock star in the creative industry. He describes genuine\nexperiences and conveys practical know-how—beyond what any web browser or art\nschool could offer. With memorable detail and a sassy tone, this book will\ncontinue to inspire you for a lifetime.”\n\n**—Lynda Hodge**  \n** _Freelance Graphic Designer_**\n\n“Mike Janda knows that a successful career isn’t built on talent alone; that\nit takes certain skills to actually stay in business. With this book he shares\nthe fruit of his experience in a fun, concise, and memorable way.”\n\n**—Lawrence Terenzi**  \n** _Director, Product Development, Crackle_**\n\n“It takes more than just mad skills and skinny jeans to thrive in this\nindustry. Finally, a book for creatives with tangible and proven ways to be a\nsuccessful designer. After 13 years of professional design, this book makes me\nfeel like a newb; I am recommending it to all of my designers and developers.”\n\n**—Josh Child**  \n** _Vice President, Creative, Riser_**\n\n“As a design professional with over 16 years of experience in the industry, I\ncan speak to the importance and wisdom of the principles addressed in this\nbook. Not only do they help designers early in their careers but they also\napply to those who have been in the industry for many years.\n\nThere is a lot more to being a creative professional than simply having\ntalent. This book will help you make an honest assessment of your abilities\nand discover areas that need improvement. As you implement the things Michael\ntalks about in the book, you will find that your creativity and problem\nsolving will strengthen a lot just by improving some of your non-design–based\nskills such as client communication, business strategy, and work ethic. All of\nthese things are connected. I learned a lot about myself during this process\nand have been able to create a game plan that has helped me connect better\nwith my clients and employees.\n\nI have always had a great deal of respect for Mike Janda as a seasoned\ncreative, strategic thinker, and successful business owner. After reading this\nbook and hearing him speak about the things he’s learned throughout his\ncareer, my respect and admiration have only increased. I recommend this book\nto any creative professional regardless of medium of expertise or level of\nexperience.”\n\n**—John Thomas**  \n** _Principal/Creative Director, Blue Tractor Design Company_**\n\n“This is much more than a book; it is a survival kit for creative\nprofessionals. In its pages you will learn how to create and run a successful\ncreative business that is both creative and a business. Each chapter is\nreplete with practical, hands-on advice that anyone, in any business, can\napply to make their business more successful.”\n\n**—Kris Kristensen**  \n** _Senior Director, Global Learning, Alexion Pharmaceuticals_**\n\n“I’ve known Mike Janda for over 13 years. I’ve seen his company grow from a\nsmall mom-and-pop web agency to a full-fledged industry-leading agency. I can\nstill remember the first time I met Mike when he was our creative director,\nand I was a fresh-out-of-college intern. My boss at the time sent me to\nretrieve a booklet from Mike. To this day, I can still remember my\nconversation with him. He treated me with the utmost respect and sincerity. He\ndidn’t have to be nice to me, but he was. And he most certainly didn’t treat\nme well based on my job title. And that is why I believe Mike has all the\nqualities that all bosses should emulate. He is honest, smart, responsible,\nand most importantly, conducts business with a smile. In such a fast moving\nindustry, it’s hard to find people you trust—but I’ve always trusted that Mike\nhas had my best interest in mind. It’s not a trade secret to be nice, and you\ncan’t buy or download that in an app!”\n\n**—Thuy (Twee) Tran**  \n** _Senior Content Producer, ABC Family_**\n\n“My introduction to Mike occurred as he interviewed me for a job. He\nimmediately proceeded to deconstruct my portfolio and find the nuggets of\ntalent contained in it (small), and then on the fly proceeded to help me\nformulate my pitch to him. Somehow I still got the job. From Mike I learned\neverything I know about beating the procrastination monster, along with so\nmany other useful things, all skills I use to this day. And fortunately for\nthe rest of the design world, Mike has put all of these tips into a designer’s\nguide to getting along in the real world, with all his humor and insight\nintact.”\n\n**—Ray Woods II**  \n** _Director, User Experience, NBC Universal_**\n\n\n_This book is dedicated to my family,  \nJodi, Max, Mason, and Miles.  \nThank you for your amazing support  \nand allowing me to chase my dreams.  \nI love you more than my Jeep  \nand the Chicago Bears, combined._\n\n![Image](../images/00003.jpeg)\n\n\n## Contents\n\n**Introduction**\n\n[Burn Your Portfolio...Really?](part0005.html#pref02)\n\n[Acknowledgments](part0006.html#pref03)\n\n[**Section 1: Human Engineering**](part0007.html#part01)\n\n**_Behavior, work ethic, and social prowess have as much to do with your\nsuccess as your ability to beat Photoshop senselessly into submission._**\n\n[1) The Big Fat Secret](part0008.html#ch001)\n\n[2) The Extra Mile](part0009.html#ch002)\n\n[3) Soak Up Advice](part0010.html#ch003)\n\n[4) You Are Not Your Work](part0011.html#ch004)\n\n[5) Be Nice to Everyone](part0012.html#ch005)\n\n[6) Drama Is for Soap Operas](part0013.html#ch006)\n\n[7) No More Flying Solo](part0014.html#ch007)\n\n[8) Gripes Go Up](part0015.html#ch008)\n\n[9) The Stress Bucket](part0016.html#ch009)\n\n[10) Two Types of Grandpas](part0017.html#ch010)\n\n[11) Be a Wall Painter](part0018.html#ch011)\n\n[12) Every Position Can Be Electrifying](part0019.html#ch012)\n\n[13) Lead or Be Led](part0020.html#ch013)\n\n[14) Half the Victory](part0021.html#ch014)\n\n[15) The Value of Downtime](part0022.html#ch015)\n\n[16) I’m Not a Writer](part0023.html#ch016)\n\n[17) Toot Your Own Horn](part0024.html#ch017)\n\n[18) Don’t Work in a Vacuum](part0025.html#ch018)\n\n[19) The Graphic Design Megazord](part0026.html#ch019)\n\n[20) Live as a Team, Die as a Team](part0027.html#ch020)\n\n[21) Everyone Does Something Better Than You](part0028.html#ch021)\n\n[22) You Are Responsible for Your Own Time](part0029.html#ch022)\n\n[**Section 2: Art Smarts**](part0030.html#part02)\n\n**_The best designers take “luck” out of the equation.

I knew my destiny would\nland me at a hoity-toity agency where I would be a star designer, dazzling\nclients on high-profile campaigns for the most recognized brands in the world.\n\nOne tearful month later, after the humbling task of job hunting—applying to\nagencies, getting a few interviews, and landing nowhere—I accepted my first\njob in the industry: prepress coordinator for the local AlphaGraphics copy\ncenter. At nine dollars per hour, I was the star designer all right. Nobody\ncould center text on a perforated sheet of business cards and feed them into a\nphotocopier better than me.\n\nWith a Midwest work ethic and a motto of “OCD Is an Attribute,” it took me\nfour short years to progress from my illustrious copy center job to a senior\ncreative director position at Fox Studios. At Fox, I managed the design,\ndevelopment, and editorial elements of the Fox Kids and Fox Family websites.\n\nThe dot bomb and the dismantling of our division at Fox launched me into a\nfour-year freelance stint that would provide me with an income level well\nbeyond any expectations I had upon finishing my college degree and that\nafforded me all of my “wants” as well as my “needs.” When the freelance load\nbecame too much to handle on my own, my wife forced me to hire people.\nSeventeen salaried employees later and over a decade of history, my acclaimed\nagency, Riser, boasts clients like Google, Disney, NBC, National Geographic,\nand Warner Bros.\n\nI have been privileged to interview, manage, and hire hundreds of designers\nand programmers throughout the course of my career. One thing I know for\ncertain is that your graphic design portfolio is a critical element to get you\nin the door of prospective employers and clients. Design schools know it and\nspend 90 percent of their efforts teaching students the skills they need to\nput together an awesome portfolio prior to graduation.\n\nThe other thing I know for certain is that, while a design school spends 90\npercent of their effort making students capable of creating a killer\nportfolio, once you’re in the door your portfolio is not 90 percent of what\nwill make you actually successful in a creative career. In fact, it isn’t even\nclose to the only thing that will lead you to success.\n\nTeamwork, client skills, communication, social aptitude, production speed, and\nbusiness savvy all play a GIGANTIC part in what will make you successful as a\ngraphic designer, whether your aspirations include freelancing, working for an\nagency, or managing your own firm. This book is dedicated to teaching those\ntypes of skills...the stuff they don’t teach you in design school, but should.\n\nBurn your portfolio? OK, so maybe that statement is a tad extreme. However,\nthe lessons I’ve learned that are contained in this book are every bit as\ncritical as your ability to create award-winning design. Learn them. Apply\nthem. Couple these techniques with your killer portfolio, and find a new level\nof success in the real business of graphic design.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nAs I walk down the memory lane of experiences that led to the creation of this\nbook, I see faces attached to moments in time. A few of these require\nmentioning here.\n\nFirst and foremost to my wife, Jodi, your undying support of my addiction to\nambition has not gone unnoticed. In the brief moments that you have not been\nconsulting with me on every aspect of my professional life, you have been\nmanaging our family, allowing me the freedom to achieve my successes in life.\nI would not be who I am without you. “Thank you” is an understatement.

The Big Fat Secret\n\nAsk anyone who I’ve worked with over the course of my career and they’ll all\nprobably say the same thing: “Michael Janda is absolutely, without question,\none of the most talented creators of mediocre graphic design work the world\nhas ever seen.” To which I would wholeheartedly agree.\n\nWhen it comes to design, I’m all right. I am definitely above average, but I\nknow many designers who can design circles around me (fortunately, I employ\nsome of them). However, I don’t know many designers who have had the good\nfortune of finding the level of “success” in their career that I have been\nblessed to achieve. Why do some amazing designers struggle to accomplish great\nthings and other mediocre designers find great success? Hard work? Being in\nthe right place at the right time? Sheer blind luck?\n\nThe truth is that in the graphic design industry (and nearly every other\noccupation out there), your creative design and technical skills account for\nonly a fraction of your value to a client or to an employer. I have no doubt\nthat it is your interpersonal skills that get you that success. One of my\nfavorite books of all time is Dale Carnegie’s 1936 masterpiece, _How to Win\nFriends & Influence People_, and it is my heartfelt belief that this book\nshould be required reading for everyone in the world. Many of you have likely\nread this gem; I have myself purchased, read, and gifted this book countless\ntimes.\n\nThe book’s introductory material explains the purpose for which it was written\nbased on research conducted by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of\nTeaching as well as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Following Mr.\nCarnegie’s quote in which he believes that only 15 percent of financial\nsuccess is due to technical knowledge, while 85 percent is due to personal\nskills and an ability to lead people, he continues a few paragraphs later with\nthe following principles: The person headed for higher earning potential is\nthe one who not only has the technical knowledge but who can express ideas,\nlead people, and develop enthusiasm in those people.\n\nHe continues by noting John D. Rockefeller’s famous quote that states that the\nability to deal with people is a purchasable commodity equal to sugar or\ncoffee, and that he himself would pay more for that ability than all others.\nWith this, Mr. Carnegie would imagine this to be a critical topic to be taught\nin college. But as he points out, he has never seen a college course such as\nthis in all the land.\n\nI’ve already admitted that my design skills are far from otherworldly. And I\nwould not be so arrogant as to say that I am a master people manager (plenty\nof my ex-coworkers would quickly agree on this point). But I do openly posit\nthat my success as a graphic designer has more to do with my ability to get\nalong with others—bosses, clients, employees, and teammates—than it has to do\nwith my design and technical abilities.\n\nThis can also be seen in the way I’ve put together the team at my agency,\ncomprised of hand-picked, quality individuals that I know contribute to our\nsuccess. As I think about the current team, based on Mr. Carnegie’s research\nit is no surprise to me that the person with the largest salary is not a\ndesigner, not a programmer, and not even a project manager. Rather, the person\nlinked to the highest monetary value is my right-hand man who currently serves\nas “president” of the company. Perhaps, though, a more apt title for him would\nbe that of “Head Schmoozer.”\n\nHe is the one who walks the tightrope of communication between our clients and\nour employees. He is absolutely indispensable; our clients love him and our\nteam respects him. He doesn’t own one share of stock in our company but I\nopenly share company profits with him. Even though he couldn’t design his way\nout of his own garage, he is a great people person—and that translates to\ngreat company interaction with our clients and to the resulting great end\nproducts. So it follows from Mr. Carnegie’s research, these interpersonal\nskills are critical to success not only for myself as agency owner but for\nthose coworkers surrounding me.\n\nThis book is not the platform for sharing all the secrets to managing and\nrelating to people. There is plenty of information out there on the subject\nthat comes from people much more qualified than I. The format of this book is,\nhowever, the appropriate place for me to say that I believe your finely tuned\ngraphic design skills will get you only 15 percent of the way to success in\nyour career, rather than the 90 percent of the way that the design schools\nlead you to believe. Begin working on your people skills today to ensure that\nyou achieve your full measure of success.\n\nUltimately, I believe that if you want to succeed in your career as a graphic\ndesigner, you need to focus time and energy into developing your interpersonal\nskills. The more you can get in tune with the needs of your clients, bosses,\nand team members, the better off you will be. People will rave about your\nstellar service, and you will begin to enjoy the fruits that come from the\ntree of hard work and jobs well done.\n\n* * *\n\nIF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED\n\nIN YOUR CAREER AS A\n\nGRAPHIC DESIGNER,\n\nYOU NEED TO FOCUS\n\nTIME AND ENERGY INTO\n\nDEVELOPING YOUR\n\nINTERPERSONAL SKILLS.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 2\\. The Extra Mile\n\nWhen my career was still in its infancy—a mere two years old—I was privileged\nto experience firsthand how the act of exceeding the expectations of your\nemployers can greatly advance your career. The year was 1998, and a children’s\ntoy, game, and book publishing company located in Phoenix hired me to create a\nnew corporate website.\n\nThe dot-com era was heating up and our nation had never seen excitement around\nan opportunity like the Internet since the California Gold Rush 150 years\nearlier. The ambitious CEO who employed me had a grand vision of what his\nmaiden online voyage could become. He envisioned users coming to his site and\nfinding a bookshelf loaded with books. The user would click a book, turn the\npages to sample it, and then be able to buy it right off of the virtual shelf.\n\nFortunately for me, I had invested considerable personal time learning an\nearly version of Flash and had experience with some 3D modeling software. I\nsuppose the competition for the job was light due to the newness of the\ntechnologies, but I was certainly grateful to land the opportunity.\n\nGoing the extra mile was second nature to me, as I seemed to have been born\nwith a deep-rooted desire to please others. From day one I began to build more\nthan the CEO had asked. He wanted a bookshelf—I 3D-modeled the inside of a\nvirtual store with a bookshelf in it. Then I imported the 3D assets into Flash\nand “programmed” some interactivity (at the time, Flash allowed only some\nbasic functionality by using drop-down menus).\n\nAfter the room loaded, the user could click the bookshelf, which would load a\nzoomed-in view. In the zoomed-in view, the user could click a book spine; the\nbook would then fall from the shelf and open to display the sample pages. The\n3D store also contained some little interactive elements that engaged the\nuser. When the user clicked a sign, a ball bounced across the screen. When the\nuser moved their mouse over certain items, a tiger from one of the books\npopped out of the side of the screen with a word bubble prompting the user\nwith what to do next.\n\nI also signed up for a rudimentary shopping cart system and loaded it into an\nHTML frame so that when the user clicked something, they could buy from the\nsite. All in all, it was pretty rough by today’s standards, but at the time\nnobody else was doing anything like this.\n\nNeedless to say, the CEO was blown away at the expected bookshelf becoming a\nvirtual store. After promptly giving me a raise, he talked about adding\nanother feature to the store: a room where the user could go to learn about\nthe company. I got to work. At first I added a door to the virtual store. The\nuser would mouse over the door and it would open. When they clicked the door,\nit would load the new room where they could learn about the company. But I\nknew if I wanted to continue impressing my new boss, I needed to exceed his\nexpectations. I 3D-modeled the outside of the virtual store, so that when the\nsite loaded, the user was presented with the front of the virtual store—it was\na quirky, brick building that was sure to capture the interest of their target\naudience.\n\nWhen I unveiled this to the CEO, he was again amazed at what I was building.\nHe expected an additional room—I gave him an entire building. This time he\nasked me to hire someone else and to add more rooms to the virtual store. I\nfound a very talented person and our little team began working on a town (of\ncourse, the CEO was expecting only more rooms). When he told us to add more\nbuildings to the town, we created a world with different climate zones\n(arctic, jungle, tropics, and so forth). He asked for more climate zones—we\nbegan adding to the galaxy.\n\nOver the course of the next year and a half of exceeding the CEO’s\nexpectations, I had amassed a team of approximately a dozen employees\ndedicated to the creation of [oKID.com](http://oKID.com), The Online Kid Site.\nIt was one of the first virtual worlds on the Internet. oKID World now\ncontained online games, cartoons, educational content, sponsorship\nopportunities, an online club, and of course, an e-commerce section (the\noriginal intent for building this world). The oKID cast of characters was a\nunique group of kids whose names all started with the letter “O”. Owen,\nOlivia, Oscar, Orchid, and O-dude were just a few of the colorful characters\nwe created.\n\nEvery morning around 7:30 A.M., I would get a call from the CEO to walk him\nthrough the new things on the site. Our team had self-imposed daily launches,\nall with the goal of exceeding his expectations. The CEO was parading the site\naround to interested parties and bringing millions of dollars of investor\ncapital into his company. I had nearly doubled my salary in less than two\nyears, and was gaining the experience and a portfolio piece that would shape\nmy professional future.\n\nWith every client and every project, the best graphic designers regularly and\npurposefully exceed their clients’ expectations. If the client expects two\ncomps, send three. If your boss needs something at 3:00 P.M., have it ready at\n2:00 P.M. Always try to be one step ahead of their needs and work to exceed\nexpectations every chance you get.\n\n![Image](../images/00005.jpeg)\n\n\n## 3\\. Soak Up Advice\n\nThe graphic design industry is filled with critiques and advice. I realize\nthat I may be in the minority of people who actually thrives in this type of\nenvironment. I can barely design for fifteen minutes without asking for\nsomeone’s opinion, and I can’t remember a time in my career when I didn’t have\nmy nose in a self-help book searching for advice from people who have walked\nlife’s paths before me. Perhaps the fact that you are reading this book puts\nyou in the minority of those who are actively searching for ways to improve.\nOr, maybe you are reading this book because your boss or teacher put a copy of\nit in your hands. Either way, I am glad you picked it up and started reading.\n\nI often tell people that in college I learned how to learn. But I didn’t\nreally learn the skills and attributes I needed to succeed until I had\ngraduated and started my career. I never had a mentor, and I have spent more\nof my career managing than I have spent having people manage me. Most of what\nI know has come from independent study, as well as times of trial and error.\nMy hope is that by soaking up the advice in this book you can avoid some of\nthe pitfalls I have endured, and find increased success in your career.\n\nOver the years, as I have scoured books on design and business strategy, I\nhave found that most books contain as many gems of advice as they do\nunreasonable duds. As you read this book, I invite you to apply what\nreasonably works for you and disregard what doesn’t. These are merely the\nstrategies, philosophies, and experiences that have led me to find success in\nmy career as a graphic designer.\n\n![Image](../images/00006.jpeg)\n\n\n## 4\\. You Are Not Your Work\n\nGraphic designers can be a sensitive lot. Or perhaps it is artists in general\nwho have thin skin. Either way, there is something about right-brained people\nthat reads like a prescription drug bottle: “Caution: Do not mix with\nsleeplessness, constructive criticism, subpar coffee, or well-meaning advice.”\nIn order to succeed in the design industry, however, it is imperative that you\nremember that you are not merely the sum of your work. If you interpret design\ncritique as a character critique, you are setting yourself up in a defensive\nposition that will impede your ability to improve your design skills and adapt\nto different creative environments.\n\nSome time ago I walked past one of our designer’s desks and glanced at the\ndesign she was working on. It was pretty rough and headed down the wrong path.\nI knew this designer was a little sensitive, so I tried to choose my words\ncarefully. “So, you’re getting started on X project? Be sure to review the\nexample designs the client sent over that illustrate what they are hoping to\nachieve.” That was all I said. I walked away, confident that I had handled the\nexchange tastefully. Later that day, a few of my employees who sat near her\ntold me that after I left she went into the restroom and sobbed. She didn’t\njust “cry,” she “sobbed.”\n\nI wish that she had taken what I meant as a gentle nudge in a better direction\nas a good thing rather than a bad thing. If I did not know without a doubt\nthat she was a skilled and capable designer, I would not have hired her in the\nfirst place!\n\nIn order to grow in your design skills, you have to hunger for critique and\nadvice from wherever you can get it. Feedback is critical when it comes to\nbeing able to push your design to higher levels. If a colleague were to say to\nyou, “Why don’t you try reducing the size of the logo a little bit,” you\nshouldn’t interpret it as them saying to you, “You call yourself a designer?\nYou suck, you’re ugly, you smell like the back of a 747, and your momma wears\ncombat boots!” You have to realize that your work does not define you as a\nperson and find it inside yourself to say, “Thank you. That is a great\nsuggestion. I’ll give it a try and see how it looks.” Then you must work to\ntruly feel grateful that your design is being pushed and that your colleague\nfelt comfortable enough with you to be able to offer caring, professional\nadvice to help you look better in the long run.\n\nGive the feedback you receive a try; if the new work looks better, keep it. If\nit doesn’t, then go back to what you had. One of the keys to growing in your\nskills is to learn not only to welcome feedback but to desire it from anyone\nwho will give it to you. The greatest designers surround themselves with\npeople whom they trust both as individuals and as creative advisors.\n\n![Image](../images/00007.jpeg)\n\n\n## 5\\. Be Nice to Everyone\n\nWe’ve all heard the Golden Rule, which essentially states: “Treat others how\nyou want to be treated.” Throughout generations and across the globe, numerous\nreligions and philosophers have echoed this universally acclaimed sentiment.\n\n**Christianity**\n\n_“Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye\neven so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.”_\n\n_—Matthew 7:12_\n\n**Confucianism**\n\n_“Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.”_\n\n_—Confucius Analects XV.24, tr. David Hinton_\n\n**Hinduism**\n\n_“That man who regards all creatures as his own self, and behaves towards them\nas towards his own self, laying aside the rod of chastisement and completely\nsubjugating his wrath, succeeds in attaining to happiness.”_\n\n_—The Mahabharata, Book 13: Anusasana Parva: Section CXIII_\n\n**Islam**\n\n_“Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you.”_\n\n_—Muhammad_\n\n**Greek Philosophers**\n\n_“Do not do to others what would anger you if done to you by others.”_\n\n_—Isocrates_\n\n_“What you wish your neighbors to be to you, such be also to them.”_\n\n_—Sextus the Pythagorean_\n\n_“Do not to your neighbor what you would take ill from him.”_\n\n_—Pittacus_\n\nI was taught the Golden Rule in my youth and have always strived to act\naccordingly, but it was not until the past few years that I realized how\ncritical this principle is to a company’s practices.\n\nI have worked with a lot of amazing people throughout my career. Being nice to\neveryone has always seemed a simple task. Los Angeles is notorious for abrupt\nexchanges. People seem always to be in a rush...no time for chit-chat. My wife\nand I decided that the fast-paced lifestyle, cost of living, and horrendous\ntraffic has caused this cultural issue in L.A., but I am proud to say that I\nnever gave in to it. Years ago while serving as creative director at\n[FoxKids.com](http://FoxKids.com), I received a knock at my door. In poked the\nhead of Thuy, an intern in our marketing department who was finishing up her\nschooling at UCLA. She had been sent to my office by her boss to pick up some\nstyle guides.\n\nJust being myself, I decided to chat with her for a few minutes. During my\nbrief interrogation, I asked how school was going, how she was enjoying her\ninternship, and other friendly but light conversation. After this experience,\nI assume that we passed in the hall a few times but I have no recollection of\nany other conversations.\n\nI didn’t think much of this experience until many years later after Thuy had\nbecome one of my first “big-time” clients. You see, after Thuy finished her\ninternship, she landed a job at ABC Family. This was right around the same\ntime that I started my own business. While at ABC Family, she sent project\nafter project to our company. I eventually had to hire several people just to\nsupport the load. I added it up once and realized that in a four-year stretch\nof time, Thuy had been responsible for sending over $1 million dollars of\nbusiness to my company. One day we were having lunch together and she said,\n“Hey MJ, you know why I’m such an advocate for you, don’t you?” I responded,\n“No, but I sure appreciate it.” She said, “Do you remember that day at Fox\nthat I came to your office to get some style guides?” I replied, “Yeah.” She\nfinished by simply saying, “You were nice to me and talked to me.”\n\n![Image](../images/00008.jpeg)\n\nTo this day I still have close ties with Thuy, and I have had the privilege of\nreturning a fraction of those favors by providing recommendations for her for\nemployment opportunities. That day that she came to my office and I was “nice\nto her” planted the seed for a business relationship that would far exceed my\nwildest dreams or expectations.\n\nI belong to a business organization called Corporate Alliance. The intention\nof their organization is to help business leaders build relationships through\nluncheons, retreats, and other events. They do a great job. One of their\nmottos is “Avoid relationship arrogance.” Relationship arrogance is when you\nmake an assumption that a relationship with someone has no value to you. This\nis an easy mistake to make, and is one that I could easily have made with\nThuy. (Think, “I am MIGHTY CREATIVE DIRECTOR and you are peon intern.”)\nFortunately, this thought never crossed my mind. If it had, I know now that\nthe cost of that backwards thinking would literally be counted in millions of\ndollars.\n\n![Image](../images/00009.jpeg)\n\nYou never know when the junior designer sitting next to you may hold the keys\nto your next huge freelance project. You never know when the receptionist at\nyour least favorite client’s office may refer you to your next job\nopportunity. You never know. The only safety measure you can take is, “Be nice\nto everyone.” And not only is it important for the sake of your professional\ncareer...in my opinion, it is just a better and happier way to go about your\nday.\n\nHere are some simple strategies to help you be nice to everyone:\n\n• Smile at people\n\n• Express gratitude\n\n• Call people by name\n\n• Have a daily conversation with a stranger\n\n• Practice random acts of kindness\n\n• Be yourself\n\nOne thing that is absolutely critical in this process is to be “real.” Most\npeople can tell if you are being nice or if you are being fake. You have to be\ngenuine and sincere in your kindness toward others in order for your actions\nto truly have a great impact. Begin practicing this today so that tomorrow it\nbecomes a natural behavior.\n\n* * *\n\nYOU NEVER KNOW\n\nWHEN THE RECEPTIONIST AT\n\nYOUR LEAST FAVORITE\n\nCLIENT’S OFFICE MAY\n\nREFER YOU TO YOUR NEXT\n\nJOB OPPORTUNITY.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 6\\. Drama Is for Soap Operas\n\nI admit it. During the summer of my fourteenth year, my older brother and I\nwatched “Days of Our Lives.” The dramatic story of Bo and Hope, the conniving\nViktor Kiriakis—it was all too much to deny. There were gang wars, love\nstories, and everything in between. The soap opera drama provided an\nentertaining release from real life. Unfortunately, too many people take that\nlevel of dramatics into the work place. This can be a relationship killer.\n\nSome time ago, we met a client for lunch who began talking about another\nagency he uses. He compared our agency to this other group and said that he\nappreciated that we were a “No Drama” firm while the other group, on the other\nhand, was the “Drama” firm. As an example he gave, if there happened to be a\ntext change needed on one of his websites, he would call the other firm and\nthey would immediately have a disproportionate response to the situation, such\nas, “You need a text change? Let me get a conference call set up so we can\ntalk about it. We’ll need myself, three programmers, the company president,\nand our office manager on the call to discuss the logistics of changing that\ntext. How does 3:00 P.M. work for you?”\n\n![Image](../images/00010.jpeg)\n\nWhile soap-star–worthy reactions may be fun at home and with friends, they are\nneither respected nor tolerated in the real world. Here are some ways to keep\ndrama at bay in your dealings with others in the workplace:\n\n• Take a break when you feel like being dramatic. Oftentimes things fall into\nperspective after you’ve stepped away and looked at them later with a\nrefreshed set of eyes.\n\n• Have someone read your dramatic email before you send it. I rewrite and\nrewrite and rewrite emails to make sure the tone is just right. The last thing\nyou want is to have your client read between the lines and get the wrong\nmessage.\n\n• Have only the appropriate people on the call or in the meeting. You don’t\nneed to fill a room with people to discuss a simple tweak to the copy.\n\n• Use a coworker to get things off your chest instead of venting in a lengthy\nemail dissertation. When a client is getting dramatic, it is frequently\nhelpful to complain, blow up, or freak out to your coworker first. This will\nhelp you calm down and then prepare a proportionate response.\n\nWhen you feel yourself slipping into drama-queen mode, take a deep breath,\ncount to ten, drink a pot of coffee—whatever it takes to get your mind back\ninto focus and to stop reacting in a dramatized and often inappropriate\nfashion.\n\n![Image](../images/00011.jpeg)\n\n\n## 7\\. No More Flying Solo\n\nI recently had lunch with a networking group I belong to. There are roughly 30\npeople who participate in this group, and we meet once per month. This monthly\npowwow is mostly just a chance to get to know other businesses in the area;\nmany of the people who attend are people whom I know from other business\ncircles as well. In this particular event, I had an epiphany as I looked\naround the table during lunch: I was surrounded by friends. This group had\nmoved past being a networking group for me; it was now a luncheon with 30\nclose friends. I have individual relationships with each one of these people.\nMany of them actively refer business to my company, and I actively refer\nbusiness to many of their companies. This is like an army of free salespeople\nout there promoting my business. It was at this moment that I realized that\nyour friends will willingly and freely market your business, so it would serve\nyou well to make a lot of friends.\n\nMy business was founded on relationships. In the early days of my company, a\nfew ex-coworkers who had landed at new companies began sending work to me\nbecause I was a friend.\n\nOne of our company missions is to “turn our clients into friends.” Over the\nyears I’ve had clients\n\n• Use me as a reference on their resumes\n\n• Ask me for letters of recommendation\n\n• Ask me to help them find new jobs\n\n• Ask for advice on how to handle difficult situations inside their business\n\n• Close the door to their office during a meeting and then unload all the\ndrama going on at their business\n\n• Say to me, “You’re like a brother to me.”\n\nIf telling me “You’re like a brother to me” isn’t evidence of a friendship,\nthen I don’t know what is. Here are a few strategies to help you build up your\npool of friends and begin harnessing the power of positive and lasting\nrelationships within your company:\n\n• Get involved in industry groups (AIGA, technology groups)\n\n• Seek out networking groups in your area (many are free)\n\n• Join your local Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations\n\n• Get involved in online networking using LinkedIn, Facebook, and other social\nmedia tools\n\n• Ask people to lunch\n\n• Invite a contact to a sporting event\n\n• Get a few acquaintances together and hit the links\n\nAlso, get involved in as many business circles as is reasonable for your time\nand location (the more the better). Work at forging relationships with\nbusiness contacts in nonbusiness settings, as this is where people generally\nput their guard down and true friendships can begin to flourish. Remember,\nthough, that sincerity is critical. People can tell the difference between\nsincerity in your desire to build a friendship and you just trying to milk\nthem for business.\n\n* * *\n\nYOUR FRIENDS WILL\n\nWILLINGLY AND FREELY\n\nMARKET YOUR BUSINESS,\n\nSO IT WOULD SERVE YOU\n\nWELL TO MAKE\n\nA LOT OF FRIENDS.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 8\\. Gripes Go Up\n\nMy mother-in-law is one of the most positive people I know. When the sun is\nshining she says things like, “Isn’t this the most beautiful day you have ever\nseen?” When it is pouring rain she shares comments like, “Have you ever seen a\nmore beautiful rainstorm?” I teased her about this once, and she said simply,\n“That’s just how I feel.” Indeed, everyone who knows my mother-in-law would\nagree that her positivity is infectious and contagious.\n\nAs easily as positivity breeds positivity, negativity also breeds negativity.\nI’m not sure why, but the graphic design industry seems to have more than its\nfair share of grumpy workers. Perhaps the constant stress of pending deadlines\nencourages frustration. Or maybe it is due to the never-ending stream of\ncritiques that causes designers to become negative in their view of life. Then\nagain, maybe people just like to have pity parties. Whatever the case, one\nthing I know for certain is that the negativity of one person can spawn\nnegativity in another, which can virally transfer to another until an entire\nproduction team is infected. We have seen this happen a few times in our\ncompany’s history. One team member goes sour, and before we know it we’re\nreplacing the whole regime.\n\nPerhaps the biggest cause of the spread of negativity is complaining.\nComplaining inspires complaining. Don’t get me wrong, there may be valid\nthings for you to complain about: Your client makes ugly changes to your best\ndesign. A surprise deadline keeps you at the office late. Your chair is\nuncomfortable. Your computer is too slow. Your boss is an idiot. The power to\nthe building just went out. These and many other challenges surround a\ndesigner every day. But complaining about them becomes as addictive a habit as\nsmoking, and serves only to highlight issues and does nothing to correct them.\n\nI’ll give you three suggestions here for making the most of the situation.\nFirst, instead of being a contributor to office negativity, it is imperative\nto your success to try to stay positive amidst the frustrations of the design\nworld. Negative attitudes that stem from complaining will be felt by your\nclients, coworkers, and bosses. Body language and tone of voice are dead\ngiveaways to negative attitudes—it would be foolish to assume otherwise. Also,\nit would behoove you to realize how quickly a negative comment or persona can\nspread. Much like a rampant wildfire or two extremely enthusiastic bunnies, a\npoor attitude and a heart filled with contention can douse the flame of\ncreativity and joy in an instant, causing grumbling and complaining to\nmultiply at an alarming rate.\n\nSecond, realize that oftentimes the solution to someone’s negative mindset\ncould be found and acted upon in less time than it takes to give voice to the\ncomplaint. If you have a tight deadline, for example, hunker down and get to\nwork. The time you waste complaining to your coworker about your client and\ntheir unrealistic deadline could be better used in actually working toward\nachieving the milestone and making your client happy in the process.\n\nAnd as a third suggestion to benefit both the company and yourself, take\nproactive steps toward improving the situation that is creating the problem.\nIf your computer is too slow, let your boss know and help research a solution.\nIf a client is consistently demanding rush changes or unreasonable deadlines,\nwork to implement a better set of project expectations the next time you begin\na project. Rather than complain about your frustrations to your coworkers,\nproactively present solutions up the chain of command in your business. Your\ngoal should be to leave your place of work better than you found it; be a\nbeacon of positivity in a stormy sea of negative attitudes.\n\nThe blockbuster movie _Saving Private Ryan_ seems to be on television every\nother weekend, much to my delight. I find myself watching it with devout\ninterest nearly every time it is on. Several of the scenes are imprinted on my\nmind, and one brief verbal exchange between Tom Hanks’ character, Captain\nMiller, and a private under his command had a significant impact on me. In it,\nPrivate Reiben questions his captain about the fact that he never gripes.\nCaptain Miller responds by saying that “Gripes go up, not down.” In other\nwords, a captain gripes to his superiors, not the other way around, and never\ngripes in front of those below him in rank.\n\nThis movie may have told a fictional story, but the advice is true. Griping to\nyour coworkers serves only to breed negativity. Griping up the chain of\ncommand can help bring about positive change.\n\nIn my company, we’ve become highly intolerant of negative attitudes within our\nteam. As soon as an employee exhibits a negative attitude, we call them in for\na chat. We dig in to discover what is frustrating them and work together to\nhelp solve the problem. We didn’t do this in the past, and we watched our\nnegative cultures spin out of control. I’ve seen a “bad apple ruin the whole\nbunch” several times in my career. Don’t be a bad apple.\n\n![Image](../images/00012.jpeg)\n\n\n## 9\\. The Stress Bucket\n\nI am sitting in Starbucks on Madison Avenue in New York City. The “Stress\nBucket” chapter has been on my list of things to write for over a year.\nUltimately, it took some experiences here in New York to inject the final\ninspiration into this task. There are cars everywhere and people swarming the\nstreets like ants. Many of the New Yorkers handle the stress of living in the\nbig city with apparent ease. But a few times per day I’ll pass people who have\njust “lost it.” One guy in particular was shouting expletives at his wife that\nhe’d “had it.” He was “done.” I was not sure what led up to his explosion, but\nit was obvious that his stress bucket was full.\n\nYou see, everyone has a stress bucket. As you go through your day, your bucket\nfills and empties depending on your activities. On days when you have lots of\nmeetings and demands weighing on you, the bucket fills quickly. On other days,\nlike weekends, there may be little stress in your bucket, allowing the time to\npass with relative ease. If you don’t empty your bucket and it keeps filling\nwith stress, it will eventually overflow and an explosion of stress will\noccur, like the gentleman in New York. Sometimes, when your bucket is filled\nnearly to the top, all it takes is “one more drop” to make it overflow.\n\nYou’ve undoubtedly heard the phrase, “That’s the last straw!” This phrase\noriginated as a mid-17th–century proverb (according to the Oxford Dictionary\nof Quotations) referring to the idea that one final piece of straw added to\nthe back of a camel would make the load unbearable and cause the animal’s back\nto break.\n\nEveryone has seen (and likely experienced) this breaking point at some point\nin their lives—that time when a simple thing makes even the calmest of people\nfreak out. Where do you think the expression “Don’t cry over spilled milk”\ncame from? Obviously, babies’ stress buckets don’t hold much and all it takes\nfor them to “lose it” is something as simple as a spilled cup of milk.\n\nA graphic designer’s life can be a deadline-driven, emotionally stressful\nworld. As my company was growing in the early years, we were doubling our\nbilling and staff every year. I was a stressed-out wreck! Just ask my family\nor any of my employees at the time. Most of them can share with you stories\nabout my bloodshot eyes, which I refer to as “Cylon Raider mode” (this phrase\nis derived from red-eyed cylons in the popular 1970s version of _Battlestar\nGallactica_); I was strung out on stress.\n\nIn the workplace, keeping your stress bucket in check is important. If you\ndon’t, you will inevitably cause those near you to walk on egg shells, and\nworry about everything they say and do around you. You really have two choices\nwhen it comes to managing your stress. You can either have a really big stress\nbucket, or you can empty a smaller bucket regularly. Here are some techniques\nthat I’ve learned in the trenches to keep my stress bucket in check. Keep in\nmind these are in no way backed by scientific research or focus-group testing;\nthey are just a few things I do in an effort to keep my stress bucket from\ngushing over:\n\n• Take a break. Get up from your desk and go for a short walk. Take a few deep\nbreaths and get that oxygen flowing.\n\n• Clean up your desk and your work area, since clutter contributes to stress.\nKeeping your workspace organized and clean lightens your load.\n\n• File emails. My Inbox is my lifeblood. If it gets loaded with hundreds of\nmessages, I start worrying that I’ve forgotten something. Keep your Inbox\nclean, and make sure that you respond quickly to your emails to keep them from\nbuilding up and adding drops of stress to your bucket.\n\n• Get a task started. Sometimes the mounting pressure of an upcoming task can\nbe lessened by simply getting it started. If you have some comps to design,\ntake a few minutes to create a new Photoshop file with the correct dimensions.\nPlace some of your design assets into the document on separate layers, and\nthen save the file. This simple task takes only a couple of minutes and can\nlighten your load just enough so your stress bucket doesn’t overflow.\n\n• Take out a piece of paper and write down every task you have to complete.\nThis activity often reveals that you have less to do than you think. And even\nif you have more to do than you think, the organization of information helps\nto relieve some of the burden.\n\n• Keep your finances in check. It comes as no surprise that, unfortunately,\nthe bulk of the stress that people face often relates to money. As a business\nowner, I regularly watch hundreds of thousands of dollars come into the\ncompany’s bank account and then go right back out. It stresses me out! I’ve\nfound that much of this stress can be alleviated by simply counting the money.\nAdd it all up and then figure out how long it will last you. (See the chapter\ntitled “[Next Worry Date](part0114.html#ch103)” in [Section\n5](part0089.html#part05) for additional information.)\n\n• Email your clients. Sometimes stress can mount from not knowing where you\nstand with your clients. Take a few minutes and email a message of\nappreciation. A quick email like, “Just wanted to let you know that we enjoy\nworking with you and appreciate the projects you send our way. Thanks for\nbeing a great client,” can entice a response from a client like, “Thanks for\nthe message. We enjoy working with you, too.” This type of positive\naffirmation response can take stress out of your bucket.\n\n• During one fast-growing year in my business, I drank an awful lot of diet\ncola drinks. I now refer to that year as “The Anxiety Disorder of 2006.” I am\nspeaking only from personal, not scientific, experience when I say that\ncaffeine contributes to stress; I know it contributed to mine. You can dig up\nplenty of research out there that discusses the effects that caffeine has on\nthe body.\n\n• Get regular exercise. Not only am I a workaholic, I’m a work-out-aholic. I\nhit the gym at least five days a week in the mornings before I go into the\noffice. I know that regular exercise helps to lessen stress.\n\n• Sleep seven to eight hours per night. Giving your body the rest it needs\nhelps keep your stress bucket from overflowing.\n\n• Eat healthy. Again, no scientific research here—just a simple truth that is\ngrounded in my own life experience. Consuming healthy foods keeps your body\nfunctioning properly and can have a positive impact on your stress level.\n\n• Mend a bridge. Many of us carry long-term burdens by having damaged\nrelationships in our past. Walking around with this baggage can make the\nminimum level in your stress bucket be at least halfway full (or more). Figure\nout some ways to mend the bridge and humble yourself enough to act on them.\n\nThe stress bucket is real, and keeping it from overflowing can be a challenge\nin the stressful, deadline-driven world of graphic design. The best way to\nfight against this is to have an arsenal of stress-fighting techniques at the\nready for whenever the need arises.\n\n![Image](../images/00013.jpeg)\n\n* * *\n\nTHE STRESS BUCKET IS REAL,\n\nAND KEEPING IT\n\nFROM OVERFLOWING\n\nCAN BE A CHALLENGE\n\nIN THE STRESSFUL,\n\nDEADLINE-DRIVEN WORLD\n\nOF GRAPHIC DESIGN.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 10\\. Two Types of Grandpas\n\nBad things happen to good people. It’s a fact. No matter how talented and\nfilled with integrity you are, you will have some pretty miserable\nprofessional moments:\n\n• You might find yourself laid off and have trouble finding a new job.\n\n• You might have to deal regularly with an overbearing, idiotic, know-it-all\nboss.\n\n• Perhaps you’ll lose money, maybe even a lot of it.\n\n• Clients will abuse you and pull projects from you.\n\n• Some clients may even drop you as a vendor through no apparent fault of your\nown.\n\n• You’ll probably get stiffed on an invoice or two...or three...\n\n• Late nights will happen.\n\n• There will be bugs in your code or computer crashes that make you go\nprematurely gray.\n\n• Clients will change scope on a project over and over again, and still expect\nyou to execute for the same amount of money.\n\n• The best comps you have ever created may be thrown in the trash with\ninstructions to go back to the drawing board.\n\n• The proverbial bus will probably roll over you again and again.\n\nYou can’t avoid it. These things happen in nearly everyone’s career.\n(Everything in the above list has happened in mine.) There is virtually\nnothing you can do to prevent the inevitable, but the one thing you have\ncontrol over is how you react. You have control over yourself. Through it all,\nhow you use that control will mean one of two things will happen: You will\neither become Grandpa #1 or Grandpa #2.\n\nGrandpa #1 is the guy who everybody knows and secretly fears. Perhaps he lived\ndown the street when you were a kid. He was the old, crotchety character\nsitting on the front porch. Every time you came near his yard you were nervous\nthat he’d start yelling at you to stay off his grass. Maybe he falsely accused\nyou of stepping on his flowers. Most likely he has a BB gun on his lap waiting\nfor the neighbor’s dog to set “just one foot” on his lawn. Grandpa #1 is a\ngrumpy old man who seems to be against everything in the world. Everything he\nsees is negative. “The world is circling the drain on the way to perdition,”\nhe thinks.\n\nGrandpa #2 is quite different. Most people know a Grandpa #2. He is the guy\nwho has all the answers. His gentle, patient soul calms the whole family—all\nthe way down to the great, great grandkids. He is admired and revered by all\nwho know him. He has seen it all in his life and therefore can help guide you\nthrough the challenges that come your way. He is a sage, a captain, a tried\nand true leader. When the world is in chaos all around, Grandpa #2 calmly\nsays, “All this will pass and we’ll be just fine.”\n\nGrandpa #1 and Grandpa #2 probably had very similar lives. Both, like everyone\nelse in the world, had their fair share of challenges and trials. The big\ndifference between the two, however, was how they chose to deal with\nadversity. And these choices had a lot to do with the things they said to\nthemselves in their toughest times.\n\nThroughout his life as the world raged around him, Grandpa #1 likely said\nthings like this:\n\n“Who is to blame for this problem? Cuz it certainly isn’t me!”\n\n“This sucks. One more thing like this and I’m quitting.”\n\n“The Man is keeping me down.”\n\n“My boss is such a jerk.”\n\nOn the other hand, Grandpa #2 probably viewed things differently and asked\nhimself this:\n\n“What can I learn from this experience?”\n\n“What do I need to change in my life so I don’t have this same challenge\nagain?”\n\n“How can I help others avoid this problem?”\n\n“What steps do I need to take to remedy this situation?”\n\nThis simple difference in point of view meant Grandpa #1 grew to become an\nunapproachable grump, while Grandpa #2 grew to become patient and wise. How we\nturn out in life has everything to do with how we respond to the challenges we\ninevitably will face.\n\nPay attention to the things you say to yourself the next time your boss shoots\ndown your comps or a client chews you out. Who are you becoming, Grandpa #1 or\nGrandpa #2?\n\n\n## 11\\. Be a Wall Painter\n\nIn the early days of my business, after hiring a new employee we would all go\nout to lunch together to celebrate the new addition to our team. This\ntradition included the “telling of our worst jobs ever.” The new employee\nwould tell us their worst job and then the current reigning champion of the\n“worst job ever stories” would tell their story.\n\nNate, one of our first hires, is still the reigning champion. Nobody has\nknocked him off the worst job pedestal. What is his claim to “worst job” fame?\nIt was his time making dog jerky. He would put on a rubber suit and spend all\nday in a freezer room pouring frozen meat by-products into a giant blender. At\nthe start of the day, the meat by-products would be frozen. But as the day\nprogressed, things would begin to thaw, and the freezer and his rubber suit\nwould quickly fill with the blood and guts of the once-frozen meat.\nInevitably, the rotten smell would seep through the rubber suit, mix with his\nsweat, and embed itself deep into Nate’s skin. Even a long, hot shower after\nhis hard day of work would not expunge the putrid smell from his pores.\n\nThis job (and I’m sure many others) that Nate has held in his life have molded\nhim into one of the most hardworking, dedicated, and humble people I have ever\nworked with. Although he is a designer and production artist at our company,\nhe is nearly always the first person to volunteer for any odd job that comes\nup. It is not uncommon to see Nate move a desk, paint a wall, take out trash,\nclean out a storage room, or change a light bulb. He does these things without\ncomplaint and I often imagine that he is comparing his cushy job sitting in an\noffice chair designing things on his computer to his grueling days making dog\njerky. Nate was our company’s first Employee of the Year, and his service-\nminded attitude continues to make him invaluable to our business.\n\n![Image](../images/00014.jpeg)\n\nI was recently watching a biography about Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s.\nI was astonished to learn that one out of eight Americans has worked at\nMcDonald’s. If you happen to be one of the fortunate 12.5 percent of the\nnation who has worked there, I say, “Congratulations.” You are probably a\nbetter worker for it.\n\nSometimes I joke to our team, “We’ll fly out and plunge our client’s toilets\nif they ask us to.” It comes out as a joke, but truthfully, I would do it. It\nis not beneath me.\n\nI am grateful for the work ethic and lessons I learned in each of my humble\njobs. Here is a list of my colorful job history:\n\n• Detassled corn (entailed walking through corn fields pulling the leaves off\nthe top of each stalk)\n\n• Babysitter\n\n• YMCA youth day-camp counselor\n\n• Lawn mower for neighbors’ yards\n\n• YMCA lifeguard\n\n• YMCA swimming and diving instructor\n\n• YMCA fitness center consultant\n\n• Wagon Wheel Playhouse usher\n\n• Walmart (stocked shelves in third shift)*\n\n• Temp employee (fed a binder)\n\n• Ponderosa restaurant waiter*\n\n• Lawn mower for the school system\n\n• Arby’s restaurant (I made the sandwiches)*\n\n• Roofer\n\n• Head Start preschool (teacher for Spanish-speaking migrant worker children)\n\n• Indiana University football (ushered for football games)\n\n• Indiana University graduate dorm library (yep, I was a librarian)\n\n• Telemarketer\n\n• AlphaGraphics (prepress coordinator—my first job out of college)\n\n• Reynolds Graphics (junior designer)\n\n• Market Direct (graphic designer at a direct marketing agency)\n\n• Futech/oKID (creative director)\n\n• Fox (senior creative director, Fox Studio; managed the design, development,\nand editorial of the Fox Kids and the Fox Family websites)\n\n• Riser (founder, CEO, toilet cleaner, wall painter)*\n\nI put an asterisk next to each job in which I cleaned a public restroom at one\ntime or another. I’m not presuming that my eclectic job history makes me\nbetter than other people. However, I know that I am a better person than I\nwould have been had I not gone through these diverse job experiences. I\nappreciate what I do for a living and know that many (if not most) people\ndon’t have the luxury of making their hobby into a living.\n\nProudly, I don’t hold any prejudices...except for one. I believe you are a\nbetter person if you’ve ever had a job that required you to clean a public\nrestroom. This humbling task teaches so many lessons, among which is the\nwillingness to do whatever the job requires. I have seen over and over again\nin my career that the people who are willing to go the extra mile and do\nwhatever task is required of them by their boss or client are among the most\nvalued in the company.\n\nWe have won many awards throughout our company’s history, one of which is the\n“Best of State” award for Utah, and which we have proudly won many times. Each\nyear businesses are selected to win this award in several different\ncategories, our category being “Graphic Design,” not surprisingly. What may\ncome as a surprise to some graphic designers is that the “Graphic Design”\ncategory is a subcategory of “Business Services.”\n[Dictionary.com](http://Dictionary.com) defines the word “service” as the act\nof being helpful, aiding in something, or doing someone a service.\n\nIn order to fully succeed in their career, “service” must be at the heart of a\ngraphic designer’s goals. Your job is to make a client’s life easier. They are\ncoming to you in need of help. They can’t design these things themselves. They\nhave external pressures mounting on them that only you can alleviate.\nUltimately, cleaning public toilets early in life is not the only way to learn\ngratitude and humble service to others. Many people are fortunate to learn\nthese lessons in their homes. Others are born with service built deep inside\nof them. Regardless of how you learn to serve, learn it and learn it well.\nGraphic design is a service-based industry, and thus requires humility and a\nstrong work ethic.\n\n\n## 12\\. Every Position Can Be Electrifying\n\nThere are three things that I really love in this world: my family, the\nChicago Bears, and my Jeep. Which order these fall in, I’ll let you decide.\nDevin Hester is a kick returner on the Chicago Bears. In 2006 and 2007, he\nbroke the NFL single-season record for kick returns two years in a row. In his\nfirst two NFL seasons, he had 11 total kick or punt returns; that is only two\nreturns shy of the all-time NFL record of 13 held by Brian Mitchell (which\ntook Brian Mitchell an entire NFL career to set.) Devin Hester is a game\nchanger.\n\n![Image](../images/00015.jpeg)\n\nNow let’s run down the list of other electrifying players in NFL history\n(Peyton Manning, Barry Sanders, Randy Moss, Walter Payton, and Joe Montana may\ncome to mind). For those of you not up-to-date on football stats, that list\ncontains quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers...typically the\nposition played by the “electrifying” and “difference making” players. In the\n2006 season, Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears was arguably the most\nelectrifying, game changing player in the entire NFL and he is a KICK\nRETURNER! Now take a minute and name other kick returners in the NFL...maybe\nyou came up with one or two...maybe (out of 31 other teams). The kick returner\nposition has never been what Devin Hester made it to be in his first two\nseasons.\n\nSo what is my point?\n\n**In football team terms:** In the NFL, you don’t have to be the quarterback\nto make an impact. Devin Hester proves that a kick returner can have as big an\nimpact on the success of a team as the superstar quarterback, running back, or\nwide receiver. In the case of Devin Hester, he made it so that opposing teams\nhad to alter their game strategies; by the end of the 2007 season, many teams\neven began kicking the ball away from him to keep him from having a chance to\nmake a game-changing play.\n\n**In graphic design team terms:** You don’t have to be the art director,\ncreative director, CTO, or VP of blah-de-blah agency to be a key member of a\ncompany. Any role, any position, in any organization can have a huge impact on\nthe success of the organization. Throughout my career, I have seen junior\nprogrammers and junior designers make HUGE impacts on company success. By\nstriving to maximize your contribution, regardless of the position you fill on\nthe org chart, you can make an impact.\n\nHere are a few questions you can ask yourself to help you become electrifying\nin your current role:\n\n• What could I do to be better at my job?\n\n• What are some areas in this company that need improvement and what can I do\nto help improve them?\n\n• What should I be learning to help me improve my skills?\n\n• How can I help my coworkers with their job responsibilities?\n\n• Is there something I can do to help improve our office culture?\n\n• How are our production processes working and what suggestions can I make to\nimprove them?\n\n• What are my unique qualities and characteristics that I can utilize outside\nof my current role?\n\n• Am I dedicating some time each day to thinking outside of the box? Or am I\ndoing only the jobs assigned to me?\n\nAsk yourself these questions and get serious about answering them, and you\nwill be well on your way to becoming a dominant player on your company’s team.\n\n![Image](../images/00016.jpeg)\n\n* * *\n\nYOU DON’T HAVE TO BE\n\nTHE ART DIRECTOR,\n\nCREATIVE DIRECTOR, CTO, OR\n\nVP OF BLAH-DE-BLAH AGENCY\n\nTO BE A KEY MEMBER\n\nOF A COMPANY.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 13\\. Lead or Be Led\n\nI was recently attending a meeting where the speaker was talking about the Boy\nScout program. I was struck by something he said while relating a story about\na new scoutmaster he was going to be working with. The speaker gave the\nscoutmaster a set of Scout manuals to which the scoutmaster responded, “Now\nwhich of these do I really have to read?” The speaker then promptly replied,\n“Well, that depends on whether you want to LEAD or be LED.”\n\nThis statement had a huge impact on me. Among many other attributes that the\nleaders around us possess, this statement emphasizes that leaders are\nfrequently the most educated about the subject matter, and the most prepared\nto guide others and make decisions based on their understanding of the\nappropriate materials.\n\nIf we want to lead, we must educate ourselves and prepare to make decisions\nand guide others. Over the course of my career, I have been on an unceasing\nquest to educate myself on numerous things that I felt were inhibiting growth\nin my career. After graduating from college, I taught myself HTML and\nconsequently became a key employee in one of my first jobs. While there, I\ntaught myself Flash 2.0 and 3D modeling, which helped me land my next two jobs\nand be promoted several times, during which time I taught myself Flash 3.0 and\n4.0. This in turn enabled me to start creating games online, and with this\nknowledge was able to land my next job at Fox where I managed a large\ndevelopment team of programmers, designers, and editorial staff.\n\n![Image](../images/00017.jpeg)\n\nThere I began the process of educating myself in people and project management\nskills, which have been invaluable as a business owner. Subsequently, during\nmy time as a business owner I have read countless books on business\nmanagement. This thirst for knowledge has made all the difference in helping\nme progress and succeed in my chosen career.\n\nIf you want to be a leader, it is imperative that you figure out what you\ndon’t know and take the necessary steps to learn it, no matter what it is and\nwhat it requires of you.\n\n\n## 14\\. Half the Victory\n\nOne of the biggest failings and sure signs of a junior designer is to sit in a\nmeeting like a wallflower at a high school dance with nothing to say or\ncontribute to the party. It is OK to be a little shy and even better to be a\nlittle humble. But even the meek look strong when they have something of value\nto contribute.\n\nSome people are born with the gift of gab. Others naturally and organically\ndevelop it over the course of their lives. Still others need to work at it\nlike they would to develop any other talent. If it doesn’t come naturally, it\nis worth your effort to improve your public speaking and presentation skills.\nThese abilities will help you land jobs and clients as you venture through\nyour life as a graphic designer.\n\nMy oldest son is a Boy Scout working his way toward earning his Eagle Scout\nAward. I have come to know the Boy Scout Motto, “Be prepared,” as I have\nparticipated in activities with him. What a simple and great piece of advice!\nWe should all apply this nugget of wisdom in many aspects of our lives.\n\nNot only does this counsel help an eager Boy Scout survive in the wilderness,\nit can help a designer thrive in the workplace. Next time you are called to a\nmeeting, don’t be like the junior designer wallflower; instead, be sure to\nprepare some things in advance:\n\n• Be sure to have something to write on. A note pad, your Moleskine®, a laptop\ncomputer—the tool or device doesn’t matter as much as the image that you will\npresent when you are prepared to take notes and look interested.\n\n• Do some research and review before the meeting to ensure that the topic is\nfresh in your mind. If you are meeting with a new client, be sure to learn all\nyou can about them by searching the Web and exploring their website.\n\n• Jot down a few intelligent questions and muster the courage to ask them. It\nis much easier to come up with intelligent questions beforehand than in the\nheat of the moment.\n\n• Bring some advice. Plan on sharing a recent lesson learned to help educate\nsomeone else. When done tactfully, this can help you look experienced and\nknowledgeable.\n\n• Plan to share a compliment about another attendee. Do you like a client’s\nbrand or product? Tell them and be specific. Did a coworker help you execute\non a sticky deadline? Share the experience in your next staff meeting so\neveryone knows how great this person is.\n\n• Share an opinion. In your next design critique, be sure to have some\nintelligent opinions to share. Don’t just receive opinions; share some of your\nown.\n\nSome action is better than no action. With a little preparation before a\nmeeting, you can transform your image from that of an inexperienced mouse to\nthat of a seasoned and competent design professional.\n\n![Image](../images/00018.jpeg)\n\n\n## 15\\. The Value of Downtime\n\nThe day I graduated from college with my fancy bachelor’s degree in Studio Art\nwas a happy one. Indiana University was wonderful...but I remember thinking\nwith a smile on my face, “I will never be in school again.” Unhappily, it took\nabout a month of job searching for me to realize that my degree didn’t\nguarantee me a job. I also realized my college portfolio and zero experience\nweren’t exactly “wowing” any potential employers. Finally, the day came when I\nlanded my first “real” job: prepress coordinator at the local AlphaGraphics,\nmaking just a tad above minimum wage.\n\nNow, AlphaGraphics is a fine organization, but it isn’t exactly the Madison\nAvenue dream career of an ambitious new graphic design grad. I was grateful to\nhave “a job” and realized that my college degree helped me “learn how to\nlearn,” but it did not give me all the skills I would need to succeed as a\ngraphic designer.\n\nSo, in true Michael Janda OCD form, I took it upon myself to learn everything\nI could about the design industry. At every company I have ever worked at, I\nhave engaged in the ambitious goal of learning new skills. In the mid-1990s, I\ntaught myself skills that proved to open doors for me at new companies where I\nserved in creative director roles (including Fox Studios). I am also\nconstantly scouring design galleries and magazines to stay current on design\ntrends. As my role has shifted to that of business owner, I have devoured\nbusiness books to earn my “MBA” in the trenches of real life. The point is\nthat I have used idle time to build my own skill set, which has led to\ncountless professional opportunities and significant growth in my career.\n\nToo often I have seen team members and employees at companies I’ve worked at\n(and my own company) piddle away their idle but company time playing games,\nwatching videos, and poking around social media sites. Shame on them for\nwasting employer dollars. And even bigger shame heaped upon them for wasting\nvaluable time that could have gone toward benefiting their professional\nfuture.\n\nMy questions to you are: What are you doing with your downtime? Where do you\nwant your career to go? What are you teaching yourself to help get you there?\nI implore you to teach yourself new skills and do all you can to stay current\nwith industry standard technologies and design trends. Most employers are\nhappy to see employees take initiative to learn new things, as these new\nskills will contribute to the success of their business.\n\nLook around your workplace. What areas need improvement? What can you do to\nhelp? In my experience, even the worst bosses typically reward ambition and\nproblem-solving steps that contribute to improvement of their company.

I’m Not a Writer\n\nI was recently interviewing a candidate for a design position at our company.\nIn response to one of the interview questions, he naively said, “I’m not a\nwriter.” I immediately thought (but did not say), “You want to be a graphic\ndesigner? That means you’re a designer, a writer, a programmer, a\nphotographer, and sometimes an illustrator.”\n\nAs a graphic designer, you often have to fill in the holes left by your\nclient’s inability to deliver necessary assets. Also, if you want to be in a\nposition where you can consistently over-deliver and go the extra mile for\nyour clients, you need to be able to tap into a rich reservoir of talents and\nskills that go beyond those you graduated art school with. So be prepared to\npolish your skills in every trade associated with graphic design, because\nyou’re going to need them.\n\nNot only that, a graphic designer that is part of a small company should\nassume they will also have to be a computer fixer, a phone answerer, a sales\nrepresentative, a furniture mover, a wall painter, a picture hanger, a desk\nassembler, a trash taker-outer...you get the idea. The more hats you are\nwilling to wear, the better team player you will be. Your coworkers and\nsupervisors will appreciate you more as you contribute to the success of the\nbusiness in more ways than just amazing them with your killer design skills.\n\nWe as human beings were made to go through life continuing to assimilate\ninformation and grow; our ability to digest new things and add to our natural\nskill sets is what separates us from the zoo animals we gape at on the\nweekends. We would be foolish to think otherwise. It is therefore imperative\nthat we strive for excellence everywhere—not just in our proclaimed field of\nspecialty.\n\n![Image](../images/00019.jpeg)\n\n\n## 17\\. Toot Your Own Horn\n\nGrowing up on a lake in northern Indiana taught me many lessons. Among them is\nthe universal truth that “crap naturally floats to the surface.” Inevitably,\nthe top layer of the channels in the lake would contain many treasures such as\ndead fish, trash, and seaweed. Sure, the lake was filled with good stuff as\nwell: beautiful bass and other fish swam beneath the surface. But the only\ntime you saw them rise to the surface was when they were dead and rotting.\n\nAs a boss and graphic design business owner, I’ve learned that this same thing\nholds true in business settings. “Crap naturally floats to the surface.” When\na project goes awry, people hear about it up the chain of command. When a\nclient is upset, your boss will inevitably find out. If a deadline is missed,\nword spreads. The “crap” in a design agency naturally floats to the surface\nfor all to see. It is rare that a client will call your boss to tell them what\na great job you are doing, but they certainly will call when you do a crappy\njob.\n\nThe “good stuff,” unfortunately, requires effort to circulate. Unlike the\n“crappy stuff,” you will have to make an effort to share the good things that\nhappen during the course of your projects with your coworkers and boss.\n\nFor example, it is not uncommon that a client will email you a compliment on\nyour good work. This is the type of “good stuff” that you have to make an\neffort to circulate inside your company. A simple email forwarding the message\nfrom the client with a message of your own saying, “Just received this from\nthe client. Kudos to everyone on this project!” is usually sufficient to get\nthe compliment passed around.\n\nAnother thing we’ve done at our agency is the occasional “Expose Yourself\nFriday” meeting. As need arises, we set aside an hour or so on a Friday and\ngive everyone on our team a few minutes to show off projects they’ve been\nworking on. This not only lets the “good stuff” come to the surface, it also\nprovides an opportunity for everyone on the team to see the cool work that\ntheir teammates are producing. It serves as a great way to circulate\npositivity, helping employees feel more appreciated.\n\nYour boss is probably very busy and, if you’re lucky, won’t often meddle in\nyour projects. If you want to make sure they know the great job you’re doing,\nchances are you have to make an effort to show them. My father-in-law has\nalways said, “You have to toot your own horn, because nobody is going to toot\nit for you.” If you don’t have a reporting structure to show off your\nstuff...all your boss will likely hear will be the negative things that\nhappened. Take the time to prove your worth and let your good works speak for\nthemselves.\n\n![Image](../images/00020.jpeg)\n\n![Image](../images/00021.jpeg)\n\n\n## 18\\. Don’t Work in a Vacuum\n\n“Don’t work in a vacuum.” Of course I didn’t coin the phrase, but when I first\nstarted spreading this statement around the office, I honestly had some people\nthink that I was talking about a vacuum cleaner. Don’t be fooled, though—what\nI want you to be thinking about is space: the final frontier. Most of us have\nseen a movie where some guy gets sucked out of his spaceship into outer space.\nHis love interest is inside the ship with no way to save him. The soft, sad\nmusic is playing while they touch hands against the glass. She is crying. He\nis dying. He has no way to move, no way to speak, no way to breathe. He is\ncompletely alone in the vacuum of outer space.\n\nI spent three years of my life working in that vacuum. I was a basement-based,\none-man show. No critiques, no internal feedback, no fresh outside ideas—just\nme cranking out some of the best mediocre work in America. Sure, my mediocre\nwork was good enough to make my clients happy and even keep them coming back\nfor more. It was even good enough for those relatively happy clients to spread\nmy name around. But I know for a fact that my work is even better when I\ncollaborate with others.\n\nOnce I began hiring people, I was quickly reminded how influential\ncollaborating with others can be on the quality and reach of any given design.\nTime after time, I saw good design turned into great design through\ncollaboration.\n\nThe simplest way to get out of the vacuum you work in is to simply spin your\nchair around and say, “Hey, what do you think of this?” If you are working in\nan office environment, there is likely someone nearby who can provide some\ntype of feedback. Don’t be arrogant and make the mistake of thinking that your\nfeedback needs to come from another designer; this type of pride and blindness\ncan lead you down the path that leads to design worthy only of the yellow\npages. Anyone can provide insights that can improve your work. Some of the\nmost helpful feedback I have received has come from nondesigners who tend to\nsee things through a consumer’s point of view.\n\nFeedback frequency is also important when it comes to your productivity. You\ndon’t want to get too far down the path of your project before you ask for\nsomeone’s opinion, since there is nothing worse than having a comp almost\ncompleted only to realize that you missed out on integrating a key element, or\nthat you failed to utilize a groundbreaking concept that could have changed\nthe direction of the entire project for the better. I regularly ask of anyone\navailable, “Hey, do you have a second to take a look at this? What would make\nit better?”\n\nNot working in a vacuum applies to everything, not just design projects. We\nhave rules in our office that require everyone to get feedback on everything.\nIf someone is sending an important email to a client, they have someone else\nread it to check for tone and typos before it is sent. Every proposal is\nreviewed by someone other than the writer before they are sent. Pricing and\nproject schedules are also bounced around a few people for feedback before\nthey are sent out.\n\nInevitably, you will receive lousy feedback from time to time. When this\nhappens, simply smile and say, “Thanks.” Remind yourself that 90 percent of\nbrainstorms are typically comprised of bad ideas. It is better to get poor-\nquality feedback and not react to it than to get no feedback at all—especially\nsince that last 10 percent is often where true greatness in unveiled.\n\nIn the end, the best designers swallow their pride and recognize that their\nideas aren’t always the best, and they are willing to collaborate with others\nto create great design work, leaving bad design lost in space where it\nbelongs.\n\n\n## 19\\. The Graphic Design Megazord\n\nMy time at Fox Kids had a huge impact on me: I made great friends, had tons of\nfun, and gained the opportunity to work on awesome projects for amazing\nbrands. My own children were very young at the time, and Power Rangers was one\nof Fox Kids’ hit shows. I was literally drowning in Power Rangers\nparaphernalia—Power Rangers shirts, videos, toys, pencils, notebooks, books,\nand costumes were all over our office and my home. My son was three years old\nand he inevitably became a huge fan of the show.\n\nThe genius formula used in each Power Rangers episode goes something like\nthis: the Power Rangers are on the brink of being wiped out by this week’s bad\nguy. The bad guy turns into a giant monster (think Godzilla) and the Rangers\nrealize they cannot possibly beat the giant monster alone. Wisely, the Rangers\njump into their individual vehicles and combine them to form the giant\nMegazord robot. The Red Ranger ship becomes the body. The Blue and Yellow\nRanger ships become the legs. The Pink and Green Ranger ships become the arms.\nA giant sword magically shows up and the Megazord is now powerful enough to\ntake on the evil giant monster and save the world yet again.\n\nSimilarly, the graphic design world is like a giant Power Rangers set. On the\nbase level it may seem like your individual talents and skills are enough to\ntame even the gnarliest of villainous design problems. But even the world’s\nbest superstar designer is stronger in a team. Several people working\nharmoniously together can conquer tasks too great for just one person.\n\nThe “Graphic Design Megazord” concept follows this pattern: Each project is\nassigned to a team of people for execution. The team may consist of a project\nmanager, a senior-level designer, a junior-level designer, a programmer, and a\nquality assurance specialist. The roles of the Graphic Design Megazord will\nvary from project to project and business to business. The point is that a\nteam can accomplish greater tasks than an individual alone can—after all,\nthere are only so many hours in a day, and one person cannot possible serve as\ndesigner, project manager, and creative director without dropping the ball\nsomewhere at some point in the project.\n\nSo fire up the old Red Ranger and transform your abilities and skills into the\ncollaborative masterpieces they were always meant to become.\n\n![Image](../images/00022.jpeg)\n\n\n## 20\\. Live as a Team, Die as a Team\n\nAbout five years after starting my design agency, I became acutely aware of\nthe codependent nature of a business. Perhaps these feelings began to swell\nwhen we held our first annual company party at the local amusement park,\nLagoon. Each employee, with his or her family in tow, met at our rented\npavilion for lunch. This was the first time we had all been together in such a\nmanner. I began to count heads and was humbled as I felt the weight of running\nmy business in a way that could continue to provide for all 52 people who were\ndependent on it for their financial support (my dozen employees plus their\nspouses and children).\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to realize that I was also dependent on each of our\nteam members to successfully perform their duties at our company in order for\nmy family to be provided for. And not only that, each employee was dependent\nupon every other employee. The financial repercussions of a project going awry\ncould force me to make hard business decisions about whom we could afford to\nkeep and who might have to be let go.\n\nThe reality is that everyone must feel the responsibility for every project to\nsucceed whether they are assigned to the project or not, because if Jane blows\na project resulting in the loss of a client, John might lose his job.\n\nWhen money becomes tight in an organization, tough business decisions have to\nbe made. In regard to your and other employees’ worth, an employer will\nclosely examine the following items.\n\n**Cost**\n\nHow much do you cost versus how much money the company can bring in due to\nyour efforts? The more profitable you are to the business, the better chance\nyou have of being retained through all but the most grievous circumstances.\n\n**Redundancies**\n\nIf your company has three designers and one programmer, and the programmer is\ninvolved in a botched project, there is a likelihood that one of the designers\nmay be let go when finances require it—even if the project failure was the\nfault of the lone programmer.\n\n**Attitude and Fit**\n\nWhen the economic recession finally hit us early in 2009, we had to make some\ntough decisions. We had plenty of redundancies, and cost versus contribution\nwas pretty much equal across many of our team members. That left us to judge\neach employee’s attitude and cultural fit within our organization; your\ncompany will view the circumstances in the same way we did.\n\nThe truth is that none of us ever want to be on either end of these tough\nbusiness decisions. In order to achieve that goal, we all must feel the weight\nand responsibility of each and every project to succeed. If a designer on\nSally’s team fails to do their job, the result could be that a designer on\nRalph’s team has to dust off their résumé and find new employment.\n\n\n## 21\\. Everyone Does Something Better Than You\n\nIn my early twenties, I spent some time living in the northern coastal cities\nof Colombia. Part of my soul longs to be there still, as I made some amazing\nfriends and fell in love with the culture. My experience there was also filled\nwith unique and deeply meaningful life lessons. One of those lessons was\ntaught to me by a dear friend from Bogotá.\n\nMy friend and I were chatting one day, and I was discussing some of the\nchallenges I had with the personality quirks of a mutual acquaintance. Human\nnature makes it easy for us to notice the flaws in others. This practice\nbreeds negativity and inhibits teamwork, two things that can critically\ninfluence success in the field of graphic design.\n\nMy Colombian friend gave me some advice that has stuck with me throughout my\nlife. He said, “Everyone does something better than you.” He then proceeded to\ninstruct me that with everyone he meets, he tries to figure out what that\n“something” is, and then emulates it. This strategy changed my outlook on life\nand my perception of others, and I immediately began practicing this point of\nview.\n\nWhen I find myself negatively noticing the flaws in others, I humbly attempt\nto figure out what that person does better than me. There is always something.\nAdmittedly, with some people you have to look harder than with others, but\nwith everyone I’ve met, I’ve managed to find one thing that they can do better\nthan me.\n\nTake a minute to look around your office. Examine the people there. If you\ncould incorporate one attribute into your life from each person, what would it\nbe? With a humble outlook, I often don’t have to search very hard:\n\nIf I knew all the keystrokes that our production artist Nate knows, I would be\na faster production artist.\n\nIf I had the organizational skills that our office manager Rachel has, my life\nwould be less stressful.\n\nIf I knew ActionScript like our programmer Brent does, I would be\nirreplaceable.\n\nIf I had the client-relation skills that my right-hand person Jeff has, I\nwould be a better project manager.\n\nIf I could draw like our illustrator Christian, I would be a more well-rounded\ngraphic designer.\n\nIf I could work as fast as our creative director Josh does, I would get home\nearly every day.\n\nIf I was as fun and kind hearted as our art director Andrew, nobody would ever\nwant to leave my company, and every client in the world would want to work\nwith me.\n\nThis exercise produces three results. First, it keeps you humble. Second, it\nhelps you appreciate those around you, which leads to less infighting and\nother behaviors that are culturally counterproductive. Third, it should give\nyou a list of things that you can work to improve in your life to make you a\nbetter graphic designer and an all-around better human being.\n\n\n## 22\\. You Are Responsible for Your Own Time\n\nEvery designer or agency that has achieved any measure of success has endured\nthe experience of late nights and weekend work. They happen. They are\ninevitable. This is an unfortunate part of the graphic design industry. If you\nare lucky, you will work at a place that fights against the late-night current\nand strives to schedule things in a way that gets you out of the office at a\nreasonable hour.\n\nAt our agency, there were a few years in a row where we were doubling our\nbillings. This type of growth proved very difficult to manage. The unfortunate\nthing is that I often felt alone in my efforts to manage the growth: I would\nhire more people, use freelancers, create production systems, give\nmotivational messages, buy everyone lunch, give out bonuses—but none of it\nseemed to get the workload under control. As a result, our team ended up\nputting in a lot of late nights and I became sincerely disheartened by it. I\ntruly valued my employees and respected their family and personal time. This\nwas not the type of work environment I wanted for my company.\n\n![Image](../images/00023.jpeg)\n\nIn the space of one week, by chance I had two separate, closed-door meetings\nwith two different employees, both of which helped me to recognize the key to\nour excessive-hours problem. The discussion I had with each employee\ncontrasted greatly.\n\nEmployee #1 came into my office, closed the door, and sat down. He had stayed\nlate the night before and started the conversation by saying, “Morale is at an\nall-time low. People are sick of staying late. What are you going to do about\nit?” He was looking for someone to solve the problem for him. He didn’t bring\nany solutions to the table. I immediately started thinking of all the things I\nhad already done (hiring, bonuses, raises, modifying processes). None of it\nwas enough and I needed help. I needed his help, but he didn’t offer any\nsolutions to the problem. His speech only served to make me hyperaware of the\nproblem we had with morale. In essence, he was blaming me for his late nights.\n\nA couple days later, Employee #2 approached me requesting a similar closed-\ndoor meeting. He had stayed all night the night before to hit an important\ndeadline for a major Hollywood studio. I braced myself for another complaint-\nfest. Instead, Employee #2 began his conversation by saying, “I just want you\nto know that I love my job. I really like working here. I’m doing the best I\ncan to get things done.” Instead of looking for someone else to blame for his\nlate night, he was blaming himself. He was worried about getting fired for not\ngetting the work done faster. He saw ample areas where he could improve and\nlisted them for me with advisement that he was working to get better. A huge\nmoment of relief swept over me. I appreciated this employee and his extra\nefforts, and he recognized that. And his willingness to personally find ways\nto improve his workload helped me discover that each employee could work\ntowards finding the balance in their own workload.\n\nEmployee #1 didn’t last much longer at our company. He and several others—not\nsurprisingly—sought new employment. On the other hand, Employee #2 continues\nto be an important cog in our machine.\n\nI learned a lot about people and management during this challenging\nexperience. One of those lessons is that “You are responsible for your own\ntime.” Before you go blaming others for your overtime schedule, look at\nyourself. Are you using all your time effectively? Have you presented\nsolutions to the frustrations you are experiencing in the workplace? Have you\nasked for help from your teammates? Have you delegated pieces of the project\nto others who are not as busy? Take responsibility for your own time and focus\non trying to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\n\n![Image](../images/00024.jpeg)\n\n\n# Section 2: Art Smarts\n\nTHE BEST DESIGNERS TAKE “LUCK” OUT OF THE EQUATION. SMART PROCESSES,\nSTRATEGIES, AND TECHNIQUES WILL HELP YOU CREATE A MASTERPIECE EVERY TIME.\n\n\n## 23\\. OCD Is an Attribute\n\nI will never forget my first press check. I had designed a brochure for a\nclient of the direct marketing agency I was working for in Phoenix.\nAdmittedly, I felt cool that I was able to go to the press check. The hour and\na half drive to Tucson went quickly due to my enthusiasm; I was like a kid\nleaving for a family vacation on the coast, knowing that ahead of me lay all\nthe wonders and excitement of the unknown. The printer greeted me warmly and\ntook me back to see the brochures. They had decided to go ahead and run all of\nthe copies while they were on press; the paper was nice and the fold job was\nspot on. The printer’s work was stupendous!\n\nUnfortunately, as I would quickly realize, my work was the problem. I began\nskimming down the text on the front page and then I learned a valuable lesson:\nFAX is not spelled FZX! Now that I noticed the typo (after everything was\nprinted) I could not believe I had missed it before. How could I have let such\na grievous error slip by me? The cover consisted of a photo, the client’s\nlogo, and about ten words (FZX being one of them). Last time I checked, a ten\npercent typo rate isn’t going to win you any design awards. In the end, they\nreran the job and I ran out of their shop, tail between legs and all.\n\nSince this experience, I have become obsessed with proofing my work and the\nwork of others. In fact, one of my personal mantras is “OCD Is an Attribute.”\nI understand that OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) is a real challenge that\nmany people struggle with every day, and it is certainly not my goal to make\nlight of it. I am merely trying to point out that in graphic design you must\nobsess about the details. The placement of every pixel must be considered. No\ndetail must be left uncritiqued. No typo can be left unfixed. If something is\noff-center by the slightest degree, it can quickly become a visual\nabomination.\n\n![Image](../images/00025.jpeg)\n\nWe live in a world where computer software enables designs to be perfect—down\nto the smallest pixel and up to the largest print format imaginable. Error-\nfree design is not only possible but imperative to your profession and to the\nquality of your finished products.\n\nGreat graphic designers are typically great proofers. The core elements that\nshould be considered in a proofreading exercise include layout, typography,\nand color usage. Here are just a few questions you should ask yourself when\nreviewing any graphic design project:\n\n• Is there anything about the layout that can be improved?\n\n• How does the eye flow through the composition? Can you read the elements in\nthe proper order?\n\n• Examine the typography. Are there any typos (spelling and punctuation)? Have\nkerning, tracking, and leading been attended to with every possible detail? Is\nthe text ragged? Are there rivers? Widows? Orphans?\n\n• Are the elements that should be consistent, consistent? What about headers?\nButtons? Font usage?\n\n• Is anything out of alignment with the grid of the design?\n\n• Are there any tangents? Are there elements butting up against each other (or\na margin) that are visually awkward?\n\n• Does the color palette work? Could any of the colors be improved?\n\n• Have photos been appropriately treated to improve their visual quality? Has\nany cropping been cleaned up and utilized as best as is possible?\n\n• Do any photos or images appear to be grainy or low quality?\n\n* * *\n\nTHE\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN\n\nGOOD DESIGN\n\nAND\n\nGREAT DESIGN\n\nIS PAYING ATTENTION\n\nTO THE\n\nDETAILS.\n\n* * *\n\nThese inquiries, along with other related questions that you may come up with,\nmust become second nature to you. You must be able to look at a design and\nconsider these things almost without even knowing that you are doing so. As\nwith anything you want to get better at, you must practice, practice,\npractice.\n\nI’ve turned graphic design critiquing into a life game. Nearly every magazine,\nbillboard, menu, newspaper, and advertisement I look at I view as a critiquing\nopportunity. This may seem like an exhausting way to live, and perhaps it is.\nHowever, there is nothing more thrilling (albeit sometimes annoying and\nfrustrating) than when you find a typo in your dinner menu or when you notice\na low-resolution image in a newspaper ad. It is fun to find errors in the work\ncreated by an unknown designer. You can bash them up and down, guilt free!\nEmbrace every opportunity you get to release your inner OCD, and remember that\nthe difference between good design and great design is paying attention to the\ndetails.\n\n\n## 24\\. Polishing Turds\n\nCreating a quality product is at the forefront of the long list of\nresponsibilities that designers face each time they step into the office. You\nhave to keep pushing yourself to get better and to take your designs to new\nlevels. Every project is a new opportunity to design an award-winning\nmasterpiece and an anchor portfolio piece.\n\nWhile most projects may start out with this grandiose mindset, the unfortunate\nthing about graphic design is that it can sometimes become more about\npolishing turds than creating the next _Mona Lisa_. Let me illustrate this\nwith a hypothetical example.\n\nClient X needs a logo designed for his landscaping company. You scour your\nfavorite design books for ideas. You click hundreds of landscaping websites\ntrying to get into the mind of the client and his customer. You even go so far\nas to buy a handful of landscaping magazines to really try to understand the\nindustry. You know in your very core that this is going to be the best logo\never!\n\nYour sketches look great and it is time to make some mock-ups. You parade them\nproudly around the office and everyone is in awe of your design abilities.\nYou’re starting to think that you just might be the best designer to ever walk\nthe face of the earth.\n\nYou send the logos to Client X for review. Of course you know that Logo Option\n4 is the obvious choice and that the client will definitely choose that one.\nYou anxiously await the client’s reply—they will certainly recognize and\nrejoice in your awesomeness. The phone rings; Client X is on the line.\n\n“We showed these around to the team and we weren’t really feeling any of them.\nOne of our guys showed me a font they have on their computer. It’s called\nComic Sans. It was really cool; kind of light-hearted, like our business. Can\nyou try that font on some logos in the next round?”\n\nYour heart sinks a little, but your competitive spirit kicks in and you decide\nthat you’ll really show them how good you are in the next round. You make a\nwhole new batch of amazing logos and you throw one in there with Comic Sans as\nthe font in an effort to appease your client. The other designers in the\noffice hail your greatness until they see the Comic Sans logo version, at\nwhich point they laugh and point. You try to explain yourself, but their\nlaughter continues. You send the logos to Client X, confident that this time\nyou have hit it out of the park. Client X calls:\n\n“This round was much better. I think we are getting somewhere. We like the\ndirection of Logo Option 8—can you push that one a little harder in the next\nround?”\n\nYou try to remember which one is Logo Option 8. You open the delivery document\nand scroll to that page and feel completely deflated when you realize they\nlike the Comic Sans logo! Client X continues:\n\n“Also, in our meeting we were thinking you could make the grass icon purple\ninstead of green. My wife loves the color purple and thought that would make\nthe logo stand out more. Oh, and my brother was telling me about this\nPhotoshop filter that can make things look beveled...kind of 3D. We think that\nwould be cool, too.”\n\nThis is the defining moment when your responsibility shifts from creating\nunique and high-concept designs to merely polishing turds. Obviously, in the\ncase of my hypothetical scenario, the client is asking for a turd. Your job is\nto turn it into the best looking turd it can be and then get that turd out of\nyour production pipeline as quickly as possible. At this point you must check\nyour pride at the door. Don’t spend countless hours trying to convince the\nclient why your logo ideas are better. Simply accept that the design is not\ngoing to be the masterpiece you were hoping for and polish it as best you can.\n\nDo what they ask. Polish that turd. Deliver it. And then thank your lucky\nstars that the project is over and you are free to move on to the next (and\nhopefully more harmonious with your design sensibilities) project in your\nqueue.\n\nRemember, though. Polishing turds does not mean that you abandon your design\nprinciples. If the client wants purple grass in their landscape logo, then use\nyour color theory expertise to choose the absolute best purple color possible.\nIf Comic Sans is their font of choice, then make sure that the kerning and\nleading are set to total perfection. If the client wants a little bevel and\nemboss on their logo, then use all the design finesse you can muster to make\nit just right. Make that turd the best and prettiest turd the world has ever\nseen, and remember that not every project is meant to be a masterpiece.\n\nUltimately, in spite of your goal to create the best designs in the world, the\nreality of the graphic design industry is that oftentimes you must create the\nbest design that your client will allow and work within the parameters they\nhave set—even if that goes against everything you know to be good and\naesthetically pleasing.\n\n![Image](../images/00026.jpeg)\n\n\n## 25\\. Hairy Moles\n\nMoles, freckles, birthmarks—they are all part of life. Nearly everyone has\nsome sort of skin abnormality somewhere on his or her body; it is simply the\nway we’re built. In some cases, a small mole right on the face is even\nconsidered a beauty mark, bringing to mind Marilyn Monroe and Cindy Crawford,\nto name a few. On the flip side, however, there is something visually\ndisturbing about a hairy mole. I doubt that Cindy Crawford would have had the\nsame success in her modeling career if she had a pile of hair pouring out of\nher mole. Sure, in her prime she was arguably the most beautiful woman in the\nworld. But a big hairy mole on her face would have drawn so much attention\nthat even the most lustful men in the world would probably not have been able\nto look past it.\n\n![Image](../images/00027.jpeg)\n\nIs this a superficial perspective? Perhaps. However, if you conducted your own\nindependent survey, I’m sure you’d find it to be true.\n\n“Hairy moles” exist not only in dermatologist offices but in graphic design as\nwell. When they appear, it makes no difference how amazingly beautiful your\ndesign is; your client won’t be able to look past the “hairy mole.” Let’s take\na look at a few of these hairy creatures:\n\n• The client requests a change that you don’t make. This is a great way to\nfrustrate your client. You have to make sure you review and satisfy all of\nyour client’s requested changes before submitting the next round of comps for\ntheir review.\n\n• You leave a broken link or image on a website. Your client will lose\nconfidence in you if they find even just one thing broken. They will likely\nthink to themselves, “Wow, what else could be broken?”\n\n![Image](../images/00028.jpeg)\n\n• The design contains an ugly logo. If so, chances are that it will drag down\nthe visual success of the rest of the piece. Imagine the _Mona Lisa_ with an\nerrant brush stroke in the bottom-right corner.\n\n• The project contains bad typography. Widows. Orphans. Rivers. Typos. You may\nhave an awesome layout, but if you don’t have stellar text to go along with\nit, the design can never be fully appreciated.\n\n• You’ve missed a deadline without communicating with the client. Even if you\nare just a few minutes late, you will have left your client waiting, and this\nis a huge issue. It may appear to be a little mole, but it is a hairy one and\nit detracts from the overall beauty of your client’s experience with you.\n\n![Image](../images/00029.jpeg)\n\nWatch out for hairy moles. Proof everything carefully. Graphic design is about\nthe details. The smallest detail left to chance can scar the success of any\nproject.\n\n\n## 26\\. This Is Not Verbatimville\n\nVerbatimville is a land of thoughtless zombie drones who wander around like\nrobots doing exactly what they are told. Far too many graphic design\nprofessionals live their lives wandering in Verbatimville. When their client\nasks for a change, they do it exactly as they are told without utilizing their\nown knowledge of design principles or tapping into their design instincts. You\nwill never progress in your design abilities if you live your life stuck in\nVerbatimville. Your projects will never achieve their full potential if you\nsimply follow the mandates of your boss or client; you must instead move out\nof Verbatimville and into the land of Creative Genius.\n\nOne of the most embarrassing things ever produced at my company was due to a\nVerbatimville mindset. Our team was working on some banners for Warner Bros.\nIt was a great project and we were the preferred vendor for this group. The\nclient had delivered key art for the banners and we were instructed to use\nthat art in the banners. To this day I am not sure how our team could think it\nwas acceptable to send the banners they sent for client review. Due to the\nfile size requirements of the banners, the JPEG quality of the key art had to\nbe set to 10% or 15%. The results were banners with huge pixels and artifacts;\nyou couldn’t even tell what the images were supposed to be. These hideous\nbanners were sent to Warner Bros. with no explanation or comment. I can only\nimagine that our client was thinking, “What in the world are these? They look\nterrible!” And of course, some of our team members who live in Verbatimville\nwere thinking, “Well, you asked for the banners to be a certain file size. You\nalso asked us to use the key art you sent. As a result, the JPEG quality had\nto be set really low. Hope you like ‘em!”\n\nAlternatively, here is a safe approach to injecting your own creativity into a\nproject without offending your boss or client: Create one version that is\nexactly what they ask for, and prepare another version that is your better\nidea. Here is how the conversation goes when you reveal the comps:\n\n“Here is Comp A. We followed your suggestions and made the adjustments exactly\nas you requested.”\n\n(The client is satisfied that you followed their explicit instructions and is\nnot offended. This is the Verbatimville comp.)\n\n“And here is Comp B. As we were working on your requested modifications we had\nsome other design ideas come to mind. In this comp we implemented those ideas\nand feel that it is a strong option to consider because of... (fill in the\nblank here with whatever stellar and grandiose reasons you may have).”\n\n(The client is still satisfied with Comp A and is now also excited that you\nare going the extra mile and using your head. You win brownie points whether\nthey like your extra solution or not.)\n\nInevitably, there will be times that your client or boss will prefer Comp A.\nWhen that happens, please refer to the chapter “[Polishing\nTurds](part0032.html#ch024)” in this section of the book and move forward with\nthe knowledge that you offered up your best creative effort.\n\nThere are two other habits that the zombies of Verbatimville can’t seem to\nkick.\n\n**Not reading copy:** They will just copy and paste text as it is handed to\nthem. Next time, try reading the copy and make suggestions for improvement.\nReading the text will also help the designer to create copy areas that\nappropriately highlight key phrases.\n\n**Not treating photos:** This happens when designers settle for using photos\nexactly as they are provided. Next time, try opening up Photoshop and making\nnecessary adjustments to color, contrast, levels, curves, and so on. Usually a\nminute or two of enhancing a photo can make a dramatic improvement.\n\nIn order to progress in your design and production capabilities, you must\ncontinually ask yourself, what would make this better? Keep pushing yourself\nand refuse to assume that the idea you are provided with is always the best\nand only one. Inject your creativity into every project and remember, “This is\nnot Verbatimville.”\n\n* * *\n\nYOU WILL NEVER PROGRESS\n\nIN YOUR DESIGN ABILITIES\n\nIF YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE\n\nSTUCK IN VERBATIMVILLE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 27\\. Shock and Awe\n\nAll working designers know there are clients in any person’s Rolodex that seem\nto fight against great design no matter how much you try to convince them\notherwise. It only makes sense, then, that in the war against subpar design,\nthe Shock and Awe principle would apply just as it would on an international\nbattlefield. While we don’t advocate dropping massive bombs on your clients\n(in spite of the frustrations they cause you), we do advocate overwhelming\nthem with spectacular displays of design prowess that “destroy their will to\nfight” against you. If Shock and Awe is used properly, your clients will\nbecome putty in your hands, humbly submitting to your will and deferring to\nyour expertise.\n\n![Image](../images/00030.jpeg)\n\nHarlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade are credited with coining the term “Shock\nand Awe.” In their 1996 document “Shock and Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance”\n(National Defense University and later authored by the U.S. Department of\nDefense), Ullman and Wade define four characteristics of rapid dominance:\n\n• _Near total or absolute knowledge and understanding of self, adversary, and\nenvironment_\n\n• _Rapidity and timeliness in application_\n\n• _Operational brilliance in execution_\n\n• _Near total control and signature management of the entire operational\nenvironment_\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these items and their application to the creative\nindustry.\n\n**Near total or absolute knowledge and understanding of self, adversary, and\nenvironment.** You must amaze your clients with your technical knowledge and\nyour understanding of their industry. They must have total confidence that you\nunderstand what they are looking to achieve and that you were the right choice\nto execute on their needs.\n\n**Rapidity and timeliness in application.** Clients should be dazzled by how\nrapidly you respond to their inquiries and how quickly the project takes\nflight. Your timeliness on all matters ensures that your clients are never\nwaiting on you and allows you to stay in control of the project from inception\nto final product.\n\n**Operational brilliance in execution.** Every time you send something to a\nclient, an effort should be made to blow them away, to exceed their\nexpectations. You must go above and beyond the call of duty in both design and\ntechnical execution.\n\n**Near total control and signature management of the entire operational\nenvironment.** You must have defined and methodical processes. Your\norganizational skills will put your clients at ease, as they will know that\nyou are in complete control of the project, deliverables, and all milestones.\n\nShock and Awe should be the goal of every interaction with your client in\nevery phase of the project. Here is a list of Shock and Awe recommendations to\nuse at various points in the project that can help you to begin dazzling your\nclients.\n\n_**While working to secure a client or obtain a green light on a potential\nproject**_\n\n• Send the client a basket of goodies or an unexpected gift.\n\n• Deliver a proposal sooner than expected.\n\n• Take a client to lunch or golfing.\n\n• Hand-deliver a printed and bound proposal (as opposed to an emailed PDF).\n\n• Include some exploratory comps in your proposal.\n\n• Provide a line-item discount reflecting charitable organization, friend, or\nvolume pricing.\n\n• If you work at a larger company, have someone from your upper management\nsend a personal note or email to the prospective client.\n\n• Since a project green light should initiate a rapid succession of events, a\nquick kickoff meeting or introduction to applicable team members is a great\nway to get the ball rolling fast.\n\n**_During the creative phase of a project_**\n\n• Provide more comps than the client expects. This could include variations on\na theme as well as completely new directions. For example, if the client is\nexpecting five logo ideas, send ten.\n\n![Image](../images/00031.jpeg)\n\n• If the project is a logo design, put the best logos in an environment (like\non the side of a truck or building). Also, with a logo design you could\ninclude business card ideas that correspond with the logo to demonstrate how\nthe brand could extend to marketing materials.\n\n• On a print project, include a printed mock-up that is folded to help\ndemonstrate what the finished product will look like.\n\n• When you have a face-to-face meeting, print the comps and mount them on\ngator board to leave them with the client. You could also bring a simple gift\nor goodie basket.\n\n• For a website project, where the client has only minor design feedback after\nthe first or second round of comps, you could consider building out some\nclickable pages to show them when you send the final comps.\n\n**_At the build-out phase of website projects_**\n\n• If you have all necessary client assets, build out the entire site to be\ncompletely full of their desired content when sending the client the first\nclickable version.\n\n• Create functioning interactive or video elements prior to the client’s\nexpected launch date for those items. Many clients are easily impressed by\ncontent that moves; creating interactive and moving elements can help bring\nthe project to life for the client.\n\n• You could add unexpected programming enhancements and features to the site.\n\n**_When a project is wrapping_**\n\n• Send in the final invoice under budget. Everyone loves it when something\ncosts less than expected.\n\n• Don’t charge the client for extra items they requested and anticipated\nhaving to pay for.\n\n• Send the client a gift basket or make another gesture to express your\ngratitude.\n\nAnd of course, in every phase of every project you should try to deliver ahead\nof schedule and exceed expectations through Shock and Awe techniques.\n\n![Image](../images/00032.jpeg)\n\n\n## 28\\. Art Is Meant to Be Framed\n\nHere are a few things I’ve learned over the years: Whipped cream topping on\nalmost every dessert will make it better. Melted cheese on top of almost any\nentree will make it better. Putting almost any piece of art in a frame will\nmake it better.\n\nI was waiting in line at a restaurant recently and I examined the photos\nhanging on the wall. Truthfully, the photos were not very good. I have taken\nbetter photos using my iPhone than the ones featured here. However, these\nphotos were showcased in a fancy wooden frame with a large white matte around\nthem. They were behind a shiny piece of clean glass, and the photographer had\nsigned the matte with an elegant script handwriting.\n\nMost people have wandered around an art museum at some point in their lives. I\nmyself have a minor in art history and have certainly been to my fair share of\ngalleries. Truth be told, there is a lot of supposed “art” out there that\ncouldn’t even be sold at a garage sale. But if you wrap the same piece of\n“art” in an ornate frame, place it in a museum with a fancy plaque under it\nalong with some spotlighting above, it could end up selling for millions of\ndollars.\n\nThis begs the question, why does this happen? You’ve likely heard the phrase\n“presentation is everything.” In graphic design, presentation is critical. You\ncould have designed the most amazing comp of your life, but if you just attach\na JPEG version of it to an email and click Send, you are missing an\nopportunity to have that design fully appreciated by your client. Many, many\ngood designers make this mistake. Steer clear of this error by taking every\nmeasure possible to control the display environment when showing your designs\nfor critique.\n\n![Image](../images/00033.jpeg)\n\nFace-to-face meetings to present your comps are the easiest. Print your\ndesigns. Mount them on black foam core. Design a little sticker plaque with\nyour logo on it and the project name. Attach the sticker to the back of the\nfoam core. Put it in a fancy case and off you go!\n\nDesign comps sent via the Internet are a little trickier to fancy up. The\nfirst secret is to never, ever email a comp. You have no control over the\ndisplay when you email a design to a client. Some clients won’t even get an\nemailed attachment due to their server settings. You have to put the comps in\nan environment you can control. For every project, we create a web page that\nserves as a means of delivery for our comps (such as clickable proofs for\nwebsite projects). The menu page is nicely designed with our color scheme,\nlogo, and contact information. Every time we send something to a client for\nreview, we upload it to the server and update a link on the menu page. We then\nemail the client the menu page link and notify them that there are new things\nfor them to review. This is the first step to controlling the environment.\n\n![Image](../images/00034.jpeg)\n\nHere are a few other pointers for consideration when presenting your clients\nwith a new look:\n\n• Website comps should be placed in an HTML page with a background. Center\nthem if it is appropriate to the design. Make the background stretch to large\nmonitor widths if that is what the final design intention is. Make the website\ncomp look as “real” as you can; don’t just upload a JPEG and send the client a\nlink to the file.\n\n• Because print projects are tougher to send in digital format than their Web\ncounterparts, I recommend sending a PDF and JPEG file whenever possible. As an\nexample, the PDF version of a trifold brochure would be a multipage document\nof the flat brochure. The PDF version allows the client to zoom in, read the\ntext, and see even the most minute of details up close and personal.\n\n• For the JPEG version of a print project, take the front panel of the\nbrochure as well as an inside panel. Place them juxtaposed on the JPEG with a\nlittle shadow under the top one so that it looks like a photograph of the\nactual brochure. Make sure you design a simple little footer for the bottom of\nthe JPEG that includes your logo, name of the project, and date. The JPEG\nversion is there to help your client get a feel for what the finished product\nwill look like. You can’t rely on your client to be able to visualize the\nfinished piece when looking at a flat PDF. This same principle applies to\nother print design elements: business cards, letterhead, annual reports, and\nmuch more.\n\n• Be sure to send individual PDFs of your logo comps, with each logo on an\nindividual page. This allows the logos to be reviewed without competing with\none another as they would if they were all on the same page.\n\n• Logo projects are fun to “frame.” I recommend utilizing your fancy Photoshop\nskills to put the logos in a realistic environment. We’ve taken logo comps and\nplaced them on the side of a truck, on a celebrity’s t-shirt, on hats, on\nbuildings, and even on the sides of buses. I interviewed one designer who had\ncreated a logo for a hockey team; he superimposed the logo onto a photo of the\nclient’s ice rink. It looked sweet! The client can then truly visualize how\nthe logo will appear in a real world situation.\n\nGreat companies “get” this. Pay attention the next time you buy an Apple\nproduct. You’ve likely already noticed that their packaging alone is a classy\nand timeless work of art! It makes an already great product more exciting than\nthe packages waiting under the tree on Christmas morning. This serves to\nillustrate the simple truth that presentation has everything to do with the\nend-user experience—if you want that experience to set your design apart and\nreel in your clients with that elusive “wow” factor, then take the time to get\nyour presentation right the first time.\n\n![Image](../images/00035.jpeg)\n\n\n## 29\\. It Is Never Too Late for a Better Idea\n\nDuring our first six years, Warner Bros. was one of our most valued repeating\nclients. We’re proud to have them as a client and regularly bend over\nbackwards to satisfy their requests. On one occasion, a few of our designers\nhad some comps ready to send to them for a Web-related project. Toward the end\nof the day, we gathered in the conference room to review the comps. Tweety\nBird was the star of the critique and the overall design was spot on. However,\nas we reviewed the design in an attempt to assess usability, it was clear that\nthere was an issue with the navigation. I pointed out the issue and presented\na solution to the lead designer on the project. I suspect the design change\nwould have taken about 45 minutes to execute. His response:\n\n“Well, I agree that it is a better idea, but it is getting a little late in\nthe day so I think we should just send it.”\n\nI couldn’t believe my ears. You can’t retain Warner Bros. (or any other client\nfor that matter) by giving them second-rate design solutions. If there is a\nbetter idea, it absolutely needs to be executed. Time is rarely a viable\nexcuse for bad design. I intervened and mandated that the change be made.\n\nOf course, this type of thinking needs to be balanced against deadlines.\nDeadlines can’t be missed, and there are times when a design compromise has to\nbe made. If that had been the case in this example, the appropriate way to\nhandle the situation would have been a simple message in the delivery email to\nthe client, such as:\n\n“In our final team critique of the design, just before sending it per our\npredetermined deadline agreement, we came up with an additional navigation\nsolution. We wanted to make sure we hit our deadline, so we sent you what we\nhad at the time of our internal critique. We should have the alternate comp\nready for you tomorrow morning. On the new comp the design will largely stay\nthe same, but the navigation will change. We look forward to your feedback on\nthis and on the extra version that will arrive tomorrow.”\n\nThis message satisfies the client as well as the deadline. It also satisfies\nthe designer by giving them the extra time necessary to execute the change.\nYour clients are paying you to provide the best solutions possible; in order\nto fulfill your full measure of graphic design success, your creativity and\nexpertise must be infused into your projects regardless of the time of day.\n\nOf course, there does come a point in a project when you can’t go completely\nback to the drawing board. For example, when the comp phase of the project is\ncomplete and production begins, you should stick with the approved design and\nwork toward the execution of that particular plan.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make is that agreed-upon improvements generated in\ncritique meetings should be a priority for execution. You must always strive\nto produce the best work possible, and welcome suggestions for improvement\nwherever and whenever they come your way. It is never too late for a better\nidea. And as with the case of the Tweety Bird issue, that short 45 minutes was\nall it took to correct something that made all the difference in the world.\n\n![Image](../images/00036.jpeg)\n\n\n## 30\\. Filler Failures\n\nAs designers, many times we find ourselves having to create designs prior to\nobtaining all necessary assets from the client. This requires that you use\nsome elements For Placement Only (FPO). Unfortunately, without question,\nsometime, somewhere in your career some FPO elements will end up in the final\nproduct. In a printed design they may actually go to press. In a website, they\ninevitably will be pushed to the live server. It happens; you are, after all,\nonly human.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way. About a year into my career, I was waiting\non copy for a website I was creating. I was young and frustrated. I need some\nfiller text for the design, so I thought I’d vent a little. I began writing,\n“Why am I writing this copy? The client hasn’t provided me with the assets I\nneed to complete their project. This project is taking forever. I hope that\nthe client will give me assets soon...” Then I copied and pasted it over and\nover again to fill the space in the design. “Whew,” I thought, “that will show\nthem—of course I’ll be sure I put in the real copy before uploading the\ncontent to the live website.”\n\nThe next day the phone rang. It was the client. She said, “The design is\nlooking good, but what is this text in there? ‘Why am I writing this...’” She\nbegan reading the text I was sure she would never see. Then she began to chew\nme out and tell me how unprofessional this was. All I could do was hang my red\nface low and agree like a scorned dog. Since that day, I have never made the\nmistake of using inappropriate FPO content.\n\nI’ll spare you the story of when one of my employees pushed some FPO copy that\nincluded a swear word live onto one of the high-traffic kid sites we created\nat Fox. Fortunately, our internal team caught the error immediately and made\nthe correction. I suspect that employee has never made that mistake again,\neither.\n\nThe point is you can never be too cautious when using FPO elements. At some\nunexpected time, the client will see your placeholder text, guaranteed. Here\nare some thoughts on how to best avoid an uncomfortable mistake with FPO\nelements.\n\n**Use actual copy.** Whenever possible, use actual copy and images. If the\nclient has not provided you with content, take a look at their current\nmaterials (either in print or online) and see if you can find some assets to\nuse as FPO elements there. We also recommend taking a stab at creating\nheadline text if the client hasn’t provided any. Numerous times our team has\ncome up with headlines and taglines that the client falls in love with and\nactually uses in the final design.\n\n**Use Lorem Ipsum.** If you absolutely have no assets from the client, you\nmust use Lorem Ipsum text, the placeholder text used in publishing and graphic\ndesign. My favorite place to grab Lorem Ipsum text is\n[www.lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com). Please keep in mind that just because\nyou are pasting in filler text doesn’t mean you don’t have to design the text.\nYou must check for rivers, widows, orphans, and such, just like you would do\nwith any other typographic design you create. Also, so that it doesn’t look\nexactly the same in every part of the design, be sure to copy and paste\ndifferent portions of the filler text into your design.\n\n**Use appropriate material.** When using placeholder images, be sure to choose\nthings that are appropriate for the brand. Recently, I saw an employee at our\nagency reusing FPO screenshots of cartoon design work we’d previously created\nfor a major university and placing them in a new project. This was a huge no-\nno because the FPO images, though appropriate for the university, were not\nappropriate to the new brand they were representing. In other words, FPO\nimages should also be “designed” for each project. Be sure they are cropped\nproperly and adjusted for levels and contrast. Bad FPO image usage can scar a\ngreat design and keep a client from recognizing the greatness behind a\ncomp—even if the design is the greatest thing since the invention of the\niPhone.\n\n**Use a gray box.** If you have absolutely no idea what images to use, then\nuse a gray box with a little watermark in it that says “FPO: For Placement\nOnly.”\n\nAdditionally, be sure to explain to the client that you are using FPO\nelements. We’ve actually had clients ask us, “What is all that text in the\ndesign? I can’t read any of it!” You can never assume that the client knows\nthat they are looking at placeholder elements. A simple explanation in your\ndelivery email usually will suffice. (It may seem like overkill, but I\nrecommend that you even explain what “FPO” means if you have the acronym\npasted all over your design.)\n\nFinally, always assume that whatever elements you are designing with will\nsomehow make it to your client’s eyes...or even worse, make it into the final\n“live” design. Choose placeholder elements carefully so that you don’t have\nyour own “scorned dog” experience.\n\n![Image](../images/00037.jpeg)\n\n* * *\n\nCHOOSE PLACEHOLDER\n\nELEMENTS CAREFULLY\n\nSO THAT YOU DON’T\n\nHAVE YOUR OWN\n\n‘SCORNED DOG’\n\nEXPERIENCE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 31\\. A River Runs Through It\n\nIf I added up the hours spent removing one of the two spaces that people put\nafter periods in their text, I’d find that I have probably frittered away more\nthan a few days of my life. Honestly, I’d like to have that time back, so I’m\nwriting an official complaint to the world.\n\n**Period - Space - Space - New Sentence**\n\nPerhaps you were taught this way in grade school typing class. It is time for\nyou to abandon this practice. Stop immediately. You are wasting my time.\n\n**Period - Space - New Sentence**\n\nThis is how you do it, regardless of what your typing teacher taught you. You\nare a graphic designer. Your job is to make the text look nice. Two spaces\nafter a period will cause visual grief almost every time.\n\nAs Wikipedia explains, the two letter spaces came from 19th-century typewriter\nuse where the typewriter’s monotype spacing was not sufficient to separate\nwords for readability and legibility purposes. To get around this issue,\ntypists simply added the extra space. It then become commonplace to type those\ntwo spaces between all sentences. Generations of 20th-century typists were\ntaught this technique during typing class, a lesson that would prove hard to\nunlearn as times would change.\n\n![Image](../images/00038.jpeg)\n\nToday, where proportional fonts assign proper spacing, that second space in\ntwo-letter spacing creates too much space. The issue persists because\ntraditional typists continue the practice of adding two spaces, whether out of\nhabit, of not knowing any better, or from a stubbornness to change.\n\nTo complicate matters further, there is even an ongoing debate as to which is\ncorrect, double or single spacing, with each side claiming readability and\nlegibility of their supported convention is best. Studies have even produced\nwhat are claimed to be inconclusive results as far as each side is concerned.\n\nTruthfully, I am not overly interested in the historical reason that people do\nPeriod - Space - Space - New Sentence. In graphic design, visual decisions\ntrump nearly all other decisions. This should be reason enough for a graphic\ndesigner. Two spaces after a period makes your text prone to rivers. Two\nspaces after a period will leave awkward gaps in body copy. Two spaces after a\nperiod will create visual issues with ragged copy. Text is a visual element\nand must be designed along with all the other visual elements in your design.\nPlease discontinue the practice of Period - Space - Space - New Sentence\nimmediately. (See how annoying all those weird gaps are?)\n\n\n## 32\\. Comps or Comprehensive?\n\nThere is a rampant misunderstanding in the graphic design industry about what\nthe word _comp_ stands for; however, it is likely that every graphic designer\nunderstands a _comp_ to be essentially a draft version or mock-up of a design.\n\nMy own disorganized and random survey results clearly show that most of you\nwho are reading this are under the mistaken assumption that the word _comp_ is\na derivative of the word _composition_. While it is easy to see where this\nconfusion comes from, the word _comp_ is actually a short version of\n_comprehensive_ or _composite_. Although the word _composition_ stems from the\nsame Latin root word as the words _composite_ or _comprehensive_ , there are\nsmall differences in their definitions that can make big differences in your\ndesign. And the difference in definition between _composition_ and\n_comprehensive_ may explain why there are so many bad _comps_ submitted by\ngraphic designers throughout the world.\n\n![Image](../images/00039.jpeg)\n\nThe word _composition_ is defined by dictionaries as an act of arranging parts\nor elements to form a whole in artistic form.\n\nThe word _comprehensive_ is defined by dictionaries as a detailed preliminary\nlayout of an advertisement that shows placement of photographs, illustrations,\nand copy.\n\nWhen it comes to synonyms, [Thesaurus.com](http://Thesaurus.com) reveals that\nthe word _composition_ includes synonyms such as structure, layout, design,\nform, symmetry, and balance, all of which are important words when considering\nyour design.\n\nSynonyms of the word _comprehensive_ include all-inclusive, exhaustive,\nextensive, full, lock stock and barrel, the big picture, the whole shebang,\nand widespread, words that more closely match the true meaning of _comp_.\n\n![Image](../images/00040.jpeg)\n\nConsider for a moment what comes to mind when you hear the _composition_\nsynonym—layout—versus the _comprehensive_ synonymous word—extensive. Or\nconsider the _composition_ synonym—design—against the _comprehensive_\nsynonymous phrase—the whole shebang. Is it no wonder why so many designers\nproduce unrefined and sloppy _comps_?\n\n![Image](../images/00041.jpeg)\n\nEvery _comp_ that a designer sends to a client should be as polished and\nfinished as humanly possible. Every detail should be considered in an effort\nto help the client easily envision the finished product.\n\n![Image](../images/00042.jpeg)\n\n\n## 33\\. Design Like the Wind\n\nA client of ours called the other day and needed us to make a change to the\nwebsite we had created for them several years before. Our business development\ndirector called the appropriate production team member and asked how long the\nrequested task would take. “Should take about an hour, but I’m slammed for the\nnext six weeks with this other project,” was the reply. We were floored. Over\nthe course of six weeks, this team member could not find one spare hour of\nproduction time to execute the small change? There are 14,400 minutes in a\nsix-week time period. All that our business development director needed was 60\nof them. This response showed that this team member didn’t realize that we all\nwaste time throughout the day. The five seconds here and there that are wasted\nin each of our days really add up over time.\n\n![Image](../images/00043.jpeg)\n\nIf you save five seconds per minute, then you’ll save 300 seconds (or 5\nminutes) per hour. That’s 200 minutes (or 3.33 hours) per 40-hour workweek, or\n173.16 hours (or 7.215 days) per 52-week year, or basically a week-long\nvacation to the destination of your choice! (Or better yet, if everyone on a\ntwelve-person design team saves those precious seconds and we multiply those\nseconds by a billable rate of $100 per hour, we just found an extra $207,792\nof annual revenue!)\n\nOne of the former art directors at our company is ambidextrous. He uses a\nWacom Tablet with his left hand, a mouse with his right hand, and places a\nkeyboard in the middle. And boy can he can crank out fast work! Unfortunately,\nnot all of us have the luxury of being ambidextrous, but there are several\nplaces where we all can save five seconds (or more) per minute. Here are a few\nideas.\n\n**Learn keyboard shortcuts.** One of our fastest production team members seems\nto know every keyboard shortcut. He isn’t the best designer. He isn’t the best\nprogrammer. But his speed in executing production tasks makes him one of our\nmost critical team members.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE FASTER YOU WORK,\n\nTHE MORE MONEY YOU MAKE.\n\n* * *\n\n**Batch tasks.** Organize your day to clump related tasks together. For\nexample, you could check your voicemail three times per day instead of every\ntime you receive a call. Depending on your role in the company, perhaps you\ncould check your email in batches as well. Do all your Photoshop work at once\nand then focus on the programming tasks. Work on only one project at a time.\nBy focusing on one task at a time, you save valuable seconds that are lost in\nswitching tasks.\n\n**Reduce clutter.** If you have piles of junk on your actual desktop and\nhundreds of files on your virtual desktop, you are wasting valuable seconds\neach time you go to locate a file or a piece of artwork. By being organized\nwith tangible as well as digital items, you find things faster, keep your head\nclearer, and save time.\n\n**Take regimented breaks.** Get up and take a break. If you are anything like\nme, the longer I sit and work, the more frazzled my head gets. By getting up\nand taking a quick break, you can clear your head and be more productive when\nyou sit back down.\n\nIf you are really in crunch-time mode, make sure your breaks are regimented.\nKeep an eye on the clock and instead of taking a 15-minute break, take a\n14-minute break...60 seconds found!\n\n**Put on headphones.** If you are in an open-area work environment, wearing\nheadphones can drown out ambient noise and help you focus on the tasks at\nhand. Additionally, your team members are less likely to bother you if you\nhave headphones on, whether you are actually listening to music or not.\n\n**Skip the water cooler.** It is easy to waste time by engaging in everyday\noffice banter. Honestly, every production environment I’ve worked in\n(including at my own agency) has idle time of probably 20 percent or more of\nthe day, with team members sharing stories, opinions, viral videos, jokes, and\nother unproductive wastes of time. I usually don’t frown on it, and—in my\nmind—I typically chalk it up to team building, which is important for\ncreativity. But, if the workload is heavy and deadlines need to be met, it is\ntime to focus; skipping these types of office activities can save much more\nthan five seconds per minute.\n\n![Image](../images/00044.jpeg)\n\n**Tell people you’re slammed.** If you’re rushing to hit a deadline, make sure\neveryone knows it. Sending out a friendly message to the team such as, “Just\nwanted to let you know that I am super busy today trying to hit a deadline.\nYour assistance in helping me stay focused is appreciated,” can help deter\nyour teammates from engaging you in the usual interoffice distractions.\n\n**Ask for help.** If you’re really scrambling to find time to hit your\ndeadlines, ask for help. There is a good chance that some of your teammates\naren’t as busy as you are, and can find some time and ways to help.\n\n**Get an egg timer.** I’m not opposed to busting out an egg timer to keep\nmeetings and tasks on schedule. It’s amazing how much faster we work when we\nrace against a literal clock.\n\nThere are countless books written about time management and productivity. If\nyou are really interested in optimizing your day, head to the local bookstore\nand grab a few. Some of my favorites are written by author David Allen,\nincluding the very popular book _Getting Things Done_.\n\nThe graphic design industry is a deadline-oriented business. We all have\nmoments where every second counts, whether it is trying to find 60 minutes in\na six-week period, or five minutes at the end of the day in order to hit a\ndeadline. Effective usage of time is the key to success, and if you are a\nfreelancer, time is money. The faster you work, the more money you make.\n\nFinally, it doesn’t matter if you are the best designer in the whole world; if\nit takes you ten times too long to get your work done, it will be difficult\nfor you to succeed in the deadline-driven and fast-paced graphic design\nindustry. Optimizing your production speed is critical to becoming the best\nall-around designer you can be.\n\n![Image](../images/00045.jpeg)\n\n\n## 34\\. Type Fast\n\nI have interviewed hundreds of people throughout my career. One of the\nquestions I like to ask a potential production employee (designer or\nprogrammer) is, “How fast a typist are you?” Typing speed is typically an\naccurate gauge of production speed. The faster someone types, the faster they\nwork. This is true of almost every production artist I have seen throughout my\ncareer.\n\nIf someone cares about becoming a fast typist and has obviously worked toward\nthat goal, they likely have worked to become fast at other things. They likely\nuse a lot of keyboard shortcuts. They likely have strategies that optimize\ntheir time. They likely will produce quality work at a higher rate than the\nguy sitting next to them. Time is money in graphic design; finding people who\nwork quickly and accurately is critical to running a profitable organization.\n\n![Image](../images/00046.jpeg)\n\n\n## 35\\. How to Eat an Elephant\n\nWhile there may be many ways to skin a cat, there is really only one way to\neat an elephant: one bite at a time.\n\nWhen our agency green lit a kid’s project to create an interactive world with\ngames and activities for one of Pepsi’s highly recognized brands, we were\nexcited. The only challenge we foresaw was the timeline. This was a giant\nproject with a six-figure budget, and they wanted it to be completed in eight\nshort weeks.\n\nThe task ahead of us was to create an interactive universe and three distinct\nworlds (one for each flavor of the product line). Each of the three worlds was\nto include custom animations, a unique game, a trivia quiz, and four custom-\nillustrated coloring book pages. To top it off, we would need to create an\ninteractive section for parents that provided information about the product\nand nutritional facts.\n\nWith a universe, three worlds, three unique games, three interactive trivia\nquizzes, and twelve custom-illustrated coloring book pages, plus a full-blown\nproduct section to create in just two months, we knew that a wishy-washy\napproach to execution was not going to enable us to eat this elephant. We had\nto get detailed and organized on this project or else we knew it would blow up\nin our face on day 55.\n\n**Select the team.** The first thing we did was determine the people we would\nneed on the project. We chose a team of seven people to dedicate from our\ncompany: myself as project manager, an art director, a designer, a programmer,\nan illustrator/animator, a production artist, plus someone to manage the\nclient throughout the process. We also utilized our office manager for odds\nand ends support, writing some of the copy, research, and quality assurance.\n\n![Image](../images/00047.jpeg)\n\n**Break down the elephant into bite-sized pieces.** We gathered the chosen\nteam, cleaned off the conference room’s dry erase board, and began to\nbrainstorm the creation of a comprehensive list of what exactly needed to be\ncompleted for the project. We were not content with broad stroke ideas like\n“Design World 1.” We broke down tasks such as that into minute detail.\n\n**World 1**\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create wireframes of World 1 for client\napproval\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Modify client assets to be usable for comps\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design the landing screen\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create storyboard animations\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design icons to direct the user to the three\nactivities\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create rough animations for client approval\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create final animations\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create gray box programming of World 1 screen\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Integrate approved design assets into gray box\nversion of the game\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create sound effects library for World 1\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Integrate sound effects and final animations\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Link activity icons to the finished activities\nand games\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Perform testing and quality assurance\n\nTo further illustrate the point, each game carried its own set of tasks to be\ncompleted. It is not sufficient to simply task someone to “Design Game 1.”\n\n**Game 1**\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create wireframes of Game 1 for client approval\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design title screen\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design game play screen\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design win/lose screens\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create illustration and animation of characters\nand elements for the game\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Write copy for each of the game screens\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create gray box programming of game play\n\n* * *\n\nWHILE THERE MAY BE MANY\n\nWAYS TO SKIN A CAT,\n\nTHERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE\n\nWAY TO EAT AN ELEPHANT:\n\nONE BITE AT A TIME.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Integrate approved design assets into a gray\nbox version of the game\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create sound effects library for Game 1\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Integrate sound effects and final animations\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Perform testing and quality assurance\n\nAfter we created similar lists for all remaining project elements, we began\nasking for volunteers and assigning people to the tasks.\n\n**Share the burden.** As volunteers came forward and assignments were made, we\nwrote their names down beside each of the line items. Each person clearly\nunderstood that if their name was listed beside an item, they were the person\nwho held full responsibility for executing that task. In order to succeed on\nthe project as a whole, each person would need to successfully complete their\nspecific tasks.\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Create storyboard animations (Alan)\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design title screen (Janet)\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Write copy for each of the game screens\n(Rachel)\n\nBy breaking down the tasks into small pieces, we were able to share the burden\nof the project across our seven dedicated people, and we were able to get\nseveral people involved who were not specifically on the project. As I said,\nour office manager did much of the research and copy preparation. And,\nalthough there was no PHP programming on this project, one of our PHP\nprogrammers volunteered and oversaw the testing and quality assurance aspects\nof the project. The more you break down the project into bite-sized pieces,\nthe easier it is to identify ways for people to help.\n\n![Image](../images/00049.jpeg)\n\n**Feel the pressure now.** The amount of pressure you feel on any project\nshould be directly proportional to the size of the project: the bigger the\nproject, the bigger the pressure. (And surprisingly, the size of the broken-\ndown tasks should be inversely proportional to the size of the project: the\nbigger the project, the smaller the tasks.)\n\nIt is imperative for large projects to fight against human nature’s\nprocrastination tendencies. To create adequate pressure, it is advised that\neach of the broken-down tasks be assigned a specific milestone.\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design title screen (Due February 3)\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) Design game play screen (Due February 4)\n\nThese milestones should be clearly understood and reviewed regularly by the\nassigned production team. The further you can get ahead of schedule, the\nbetter.\n\nIt takes a long time to eat an elephant, and there is a lot of digestion\ninvolved. You can’t just eat the whole thing on the last day and expect to fit\nit all into your stomach. You have to create a plan, eat some of the elephant,\ndigest it, and eat some more.\n\n![Image](../images/00050.jpeg)\n\n\n## 36\\. The Venus Initiative\n\nWhen our agency was relatively new and growing, we felt it necessary to assess\npotential areas of improvement and further growth; we did this by analyzing\nthe core components that we felt determined our success as a design company.\nThese areas were profitability, client satisfaction, and quality of work.\nDuring these early years of our company, we were operating at over 50 percent\nprofitability, and we had a constant stream of praise and unsolicited\nreferrals coming from our clients. But we had never been published in a\nnational magazine such as _Communication Arts_ , and we had not felt ready to\nsubmit many designs for award consideration, either. While our work was\ncertainly “good,” we wanted it to be “great,” and we determined that the area\nof “quality of work” was the element that most needed our attention moving\nforward.\n\nOur best designers got together to figure out some systems to better enable us\nto achieve high-quality design and maximize collaboration. We created a\nprocess that we endearingly titled “The Venus Initiative,” appropriately named\nafter the Roman goddess of beauty and love.\n\nOver time, this process has become more organic in our organization, and these\nelements happen without the formality of structured meetings. However, the\nprinciples we put in place years ago are still key to effectively arriving at\nhigh-quality work and can be implemented in your process as well, in whatever\nmanner works the best for your organization. Here is our quality of work\nimprovement process from start of a project to near delivery to the client.\n\n**1\\. Art Director Kickoff**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team and art director (sometimes business\ndevelopment team members who brought in the project are involved, as well)\n\n**_Summary:_** After a project is kicked off within the organization, the art\ndirector will meet with the assigned design team to discuss the general\ndetails of the project.\n\n**_Objective:_** Ensure that the design team has all of the information for\nthe project. This includes:\n\n• Client objectives\n\n• Client’s design style (direction)\n\n• Details about what the project entails\n\n• Target audience\n\n• Understanding of what assets are available for use\n\n• Understanding of what content should be included on each element of the\nproject\n\n• Understanding of the timeline\n\n• Understanding of the budget (how much production hours can be spent)\n\n**_Deliverable:_** An assigned attendee should take notes and distribute the\ninformation to the other attendees for reference throughout the course of the\nproject.\n\n**2\\. Define the Barometers**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team\n\n**_Summary:_** Prior to the meeting, the assigned design team will perform\nresearch to find projects similar to the assigned project. The research should\ninclude websites, design magazines, design books, and any other appropriate\nsource. Each team member brings their proposed example designs to the meeting\nfor discussion with the group.\n\n**_Objective:_** Establish a set of example designs to serve as inspiration to\npush our designs to match in quality. The example designs are referred to as\nbarometers, and these designs are used as reference points throughout the\ndevelopment process. Please note that the barometers are not copied, but\nmerely used as a benchmark for quality to determine a level of polish in the\nfinished design piece.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** The barometers should include at least one but as many as\nfive comparable projects/designs from the researched sources. These designs\nare added to a project folder or digital production tool depending on the\nagency’s internal production management systems.\n\n**3\\. Thumbs Up Meeting**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team and art director\n\n**_Summary:_** This is the meeting where a lot of conversation and\nbrainstorming should occur. The assigned design team will brainstorm design\nconcepts and create thumbnail sketches for internal review. The thumbnails\nwill include concept ideas and layout/grid ideas. The thumbnails will be\ndiscussed in a Thumbs Up meeting that includes the art director and assigned\ndesign team. The pros and cons for each thumbnail are then analyzed for each\nsketch that is presented.\n\n**_Objective:_** Determine the concepts and layout or grid to be implemented\ninto the first comps.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** The assigned design team should have at least twice as many\nthumbnails as expected at first comps (that is, if three first comps are\nexpected to be submitted to the client, the assigned design team should\npresent at least six thumbnail sketch ideas). As a group, the assigned team\nwill collaborate with the art director to decide on which thumbnails are to be\ndeveloped into the first round of comps.\n\n**4\\. Battle of the Bands**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team and other individuals not assigned to\nthe project\n\n**_Summary:_** Designers and nondesigners meet to review and discuss the comps\nprior to submission for internal approval. This should be a full-blown school-\nstyle critique where questions are asked and answers are given (think back to\nyour college days, minus the frat parties, cute coeds, and ping-pong wars as\ndistractions). The designs should be heavily scrutinized and pushed so as to\nachieve maximum quality. The phrase, “that looks good to me,” should rarely be\nused in this phase of critiquing; the focus should be on “what if” questions.\nWhat if we did this for this piece of the design? What if you did something\nlike this site...? The tone from all participants should be, how can we make\nthis better? And it shouldn’t matter how good the original submissions may be;\nthink like there should always be room for improvement.\n\n**_Objective:_** Scrutinize the designs and develop a detailed list of\nimprovements to be made.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** Assigned design team takes critique feedback and revises\ncomps accordingly in preparation for the “Wow Meeting.”\n\n**5\\. Wow Meeting**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team, art director, and other company\nmanagement team members depending on the structure of the organization\n\n**_Summary:_** The assigned design team presents their first comps for\ninternal approval. This meeting should occur at least one day prior to the\nscheduled delivery to the client so that any final internal changes can be\nimplemented.\n\n**_Objective:_** Gain internal approval/feedback prior to the submission to\nthe client. Based on the processes implemented prior to this meeting, the\nassigned design team should have a level of polish to the work that makes the\napproval team members say, “Wow,” rather than this meeting becoming another\nall-out critique of the comps.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** Internal approval with occasional final changes requested\nfrom management.\n\nIt is surprising how unstructured many design organizations are. In graphic\ndesign and art schools, the classrooms are often filled with gray walls and\ndesigns are regularly posted for classroom-sized critiques. But in most of the\ncompanies I’ve worked at (including my own), this step is omitted in an effort\nto race through production and hit the deadlines. In these cases, the quality\nof work suffers. Parts (or all) of The Venus Initiative can be assimilated\neasily into a design organization in a streamlined fashion, enabling\nconsiderable improvement in work quality to be achieved practically overnight.\n\n![Image](../images/00051.jpeg)\n\n\n## 37\\. Process-a-Palooza\n\nThe transition from freelancer to agency owner was filled with adjustments. It\nseemed like we were scaling a mountain and had to continually change our\ntactics to keep progressing. When I first started hiring employees at my\nagency, we changed the production process every couple of weeks (much to the\nlament of my team). We were growing so fast that it seemed with every new\nemployee we needed to tweak the process to allow things to keep working and to\nfind the system that offered the most benefit to the particular team and\nproject; what worked for a team of three with ten projects didn’t necessarily\nwork for a team of five with twenty projects.\n\nTo implement an optimal system, one of the things we found to be important is\nto have a defined process of tracking and executing on projects. Here are a\nfew project management process ideas to track and execute that I’ve used at\nvarious phases of my career.\n\n![Image](../images/00052.jpeg)\n\n**Process 1: To-Do Lists**\n\nNothing revolutionary here, and it worked well as an independent freelancer,\ntoo. Get out a piece of paper. List the things you need to do and cross them\noff when they are complete. (There is no shortage of digital “To-Do List”\napplications if you choose to go that route.)\n\n**When to Use:** This system is easy to implement and works well if you are a\none-person show managing just a few projects.\n\n**Process 2: Inbox**\n\nOnce I started working out of my email Inbox years ago, I haven’t stopped.\nSimply email yourself tasks that you need to complete. Once a task is\nfinished, file or delete the email. It is an easy way to track your tasks.\nMost of us keep regular tabs on our email, which inevitably helps you track\nthe things you need to do.\n\n**When to Use:** This system is best for an independent freelancer with a\nsmall quantity of projects, but, as I have demonstrated in my own life, it is\nan excellent tool for large businesses and executives as well.\n\n**Process 3: Dry Erase Board**\n\nDuring the dot-com era of the late nineties, I was creative director over a\nsmall team creating one of the first interactive kid worlds on the Web. The\nCEO of the company would call me every morning at about 7:30 A.M. and I’d walk\nhim through the site and the things we launched the day before. The Internet\nindustry was going crazy at the time and we were in a race to get to market\nfast. We had lofty goals of launching large amounts of new content each day.\nOur process was simple: We listed all of the things we had to create and\ncomplete on a dry erase board; when a team member completed one item on the\nlist, they would go to the board, cross it off, and write their name beside\nthe next item they were going to tackle. Everyone loved the system because it\nwas simple and allowed for some freedom inside the design team to decide which\nitems they wanted to take on.\n\n**When to Use:** This is a simple and scalable process that works best when\nthere are many team members of a similar skill set working on one large\nproject together.\n\n**Process 4: Job Folders**\n\nThe first little design shop I worked at used this system, and I replicated it\nduring a few brief stints of my career at other companies. Each project gets a\nfolder (anything from manila envelopes to clear plastic job jackets can work).\nEach folder contains a piece of paper detailing the project scope. The job\nfolders represent responsibility. The team member who holds the folder bears\nthe responsibility to oversee and execute on the project. As the project\nprogresses through a development team, the job folder passes from team member\nto team member to execute on their respective pieces.\n\n**When to Use:** A process like this works well in a print-heavy design\nenvironment. The job folders allow for easy archiving of proofs of the printed\nwork and it is easy to document the project scope on paper, since scope\nchanges are not as prevalent in print as they are in interactive projects.\nHowever, this type of process can work successfully in production environments\nthat have interactive media projects as well.\n\n**Process 5: The Furnace**\n\nI love this process because my mind naturally works this way. I’ve used it in\nseveral phases of my career to manage a production team and large quantities\nof projects. You need a large dry erase board (or something similar). Divide\nthe board into columns (most office supply stores carry thin black tape for\nthis type of thing). You’ll need one column for each of the phases your\nprojects pass through. The following phases are pretty consistent with the\nmajority of production environments I have seen throughout my career:\n\n• Estimate\n\n• Awaiting the Green Light\n\n• Concepting\n\n• 1st Comps\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• 2nd Comps\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• Final Comps\n\n• Awaiting Approval\n\n• 1st Build\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• 2nd Build\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• Final Build\n\n• Awaiting Approval\n\n• Launch/Deliver\n\nNow create a “project card” equal to the width of each column for each of your\nprojects (perhaps it is a 3″ × 5″, or you could use Post-it notes or something\nsimilar). Then simply put each project into the column that corresponds with\nthe phase it is in. Your goal is to move each project card through each phase\nuntil the project is completed.\n\n**When to Use:** The Furnace process is a great way to get a global view of\nworking projects. It also provides an easy way to run a production meeting as\nyou discuss each project with the team, asking, “What needs to happen to move\nthis project to the next column?”\n\n**Process 6: Digital Systems**\n\nDigital project management tools are commonly used and work miracles in\nhelping creative teams collaborate on projects. We successfully execute on\nprojects in collaboration with people all over the world by utilizing digital\nproject management tools.\n\nOur agency uses Basecamp® ([www.basecamphq.com](http://www.basecamphq.com)),\nbut there are many other options available, each with its pros and cons. If\nyou are interested in utilizing a digital tool to manage your projects, do\nyour research and pick the one that seems right for you.\n\n**When to Use:** Digital project management tools are best for companies with\nlarger teams managing numerous projects. Digital systems often scale easily to\nhandle 10 to 100 simultaneously running projects. Most of them come with a\nmonthly fee, so they are best used if you are with a company or working full-\ntime as a freelancer where the consistency of your workflow makes it worth\nspending the money each month.\n\n\n## 38\\. Hiking Your Way to Successful Projects\n\nMy oldest son is in Boy Scouts. It seems there is never a shortage of campouts\nscheduled for these young men. Each campout is organized with some sort of\nhike involved, and in an effort to be a good father I attend all of them with\nhim. He loves it. I, on the other hand, love being with him...and therefore\nsuffer through the hard ground and sleepless nights that sleeping outdoors has\nto offer. When it comes to camping, I feel like I have served my sentence. You\nsee, I grew up camping and hiking with four brothers and no sisters. It wasn’t\nuntil I was an adult that I realized the reasons my parents took us hiking and\ncamping on EVERY vacation. First, it didn’t matter too much when their\nrambunctious boys broke things in a forest. And second, if they hiked us\naround all day we might actually fall asleep at night.\n\nIn hiking there are a few formulas to help you successfully reach your\ndestination. I have some experience with many of them. It wasn’t until\nrecently that I realized the correlation between hiking strategies and\nproduction environments. Let’s analyze the correlation between three types of\nhikes and their corresponding production environment. The goal of each is to\narrive successfully at the destination. In hiking, the destination is\nobviously a location. In a graphic design production environment, the\ndestination is a successful project (one that is completed on time and that\ndelivers above and beyond the client’s expectations in all aspects of the\njob).\n\n**Category #1: It’s over there...**\n\nMany of the hikes I’ve been on fall into this category. A park ranger or\nsomeone “knowledgeable” points into the forest and says, “The destination is\nthat way.” The hiking party ventures off into the forest in the general\ndirection they signaled in hopes of finding the location. Oftentimes, they\nwill arrive at the destination, likely after a few wrong turns and backtracks.\nSometimes, they will get totally lost and find their way back to where they\nstarted. And, unfortunately, other times the hikers end up lost in the forest\nfor good.\n\nMost production environments operate this way—kind of “willy-nilly.” In an\neffort to arrive at the destination of a successful project, the business\nowner or salesperson will turn over the project to a production team and say,\n“It’s over there...good luck!” The production team will then scramble through\nthe project, hoping to blindly feel their way to success. A designer may head\nin the wrong direction for a time...perhaps their boss or client will get them\nback on track. There may even be some missed deadlines. Frequently this type\nof production style leads to frustration for both the production team and the\nclient, and far too many design teams operate like this on a daily basis.\n\n**Category #2: The guided tour...**\n\nHikes with an experienced guide can be great fun. You pack your stuff and then\nmindlessly follow behind the guide as they make all your decisions for you.\nThe guide knows exactly where the destination is, and all you have to worry\nabout is turning, climbing, and descending when and where they say. Many times\nthey even hook up ropes for you and tell you exactly where to place your foot.\n\n![Image](../images/00053.jpeg)\n\nThese types of production environments can operate very successfully. All you\nneed is one superstar who knows how to arrive at a successful project every\ntime, with every client. Usually that person is in an art director or creative\ndirector role. They wander around the office calling the shots for every\nproject. I’ve been this person in several production environments. It may\nsound like bliss for the designers in the world who don’t want to have to make\ntough decisions, but the reality is that it is frustrating to everyone. The\ndesign team gets sick of being told what to do all the time. The superstar\ncreative director starts wondering why nobody can think for themselves. And\nwatch out if that superstar ever gets sick or takes a vacation. The whole\ncompany could fall to pieces! To top it all off, this is not a scalable\nstrategy. If your company begins to grow, eventually there will be a limit to\nthe number of projects and people your superstar employee can manage\neffectively.\n\n**Category #3: The detailed map...**\n\nThe best chance for a successful hike is having a detailed map, created by\nsomeone who knows the area and that is used by people who know how to read it.\nImagine a map for a blazed trail with documented mile markers and signs\npointing the right direction at every split in the path. These types of maps\noften contain invaluable advice about pitfalls to watch for, how much water to\ncarry, and how long it takes to traverse each part of the trail. It doesn’t\ntake a rocket scientist to find the way to a destination with these tools. In\nfact, millions of direction-challenged people find their way to amazing\ndestinations every year using these detailed maps.\n\nDocumented processes, created by someone who knows what they are doing, are\nthe safest way to operate a successful production environment. I’m not talking\nabout a simple process—green light the project, make website, bill client,\nrepeat. Many companies operate with things like this in place and “think” they\nhave a production process. I’m talking about a very detailed and organized\nflow for each type of project you do. Only by digging into the nitty-gritty\ndetails of what exactly needs to be done can you be assured that you, or other\npeople in your production environment, will not forget to act on important\npieces of the project. At our agency we have a set list of To-Do items that\ncorrespond with each project. When a client green lights a project, we attach\nthe appropriate To-Do list to the project and then turn it over to the\nproduction team. The detailed To-Do list style production process thus becomes\nour roadmap to success.\n\nHere is our agency’s standard To-Do list for our projects, our “detailed map”\nto reach our destination. This task list is always changing based on the\nlessons we learn from each project. It begins with the start of the project\nand continues until it’s complete and archived.\n\n**Project Start**\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) {Client} Agency receives lead on a project (via\nwebsite form, phone call, referral, networking event, etc.).\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) {Agency} Qualifies the lead by talking with the\nclient to verify the legitimacy of the request.\n\n![Image](../images/00048.jpeg) {Agency} If the request is legitimate, the\nproject is added to Basecamp with Agency as the client (in a Message add name,\nemail, phone numbers, and brief project info).

Not every client has the same\nproduction style. At our company we sometimes do only the programming tasks of\na website and therefore need to remove all of the To-Do items that correspond\nwith design. It is important to trim or expand the To-Do list to be\nappropriate for each specific project.\n\nBy utilizing documented and detailed processes in your business, there is no\nwandering aimlessly in the forest heading in the general direction of the\ndestination. There is no need for a superstar to run around the office telling\neveryone what to do every step of the way. The To-Do list process serves as a\nnear-perfect map to help everyone arrive at the destination of a successful\nproject.\n\nHaving a detailed production process has the added benefit of allowing new\nemployees to operate like veterans almost from day one. Detailed To-Do list\nstyle production processes are a great contributor to success in any graphic\ndesign production environment. Determine the types of projects you usually\nwork on and then create your own detailed list of successful tasks for each of\nthose project types.\n\n![Image](../images/00054.jpeg)\n\n\n## 39\\. Solving End-of-Day Rush\n\nWhen I started my design agency, the first few people I hired were junior\nemployees. Admittedly, I was afraid of the burden of a higher-paid employee\nand took financial comfort in a low-cost solution. As we began to grow as a\nbusiness, our employees grew in their skills as well. They had earned the\nopportunity for promotion as we began hiring more junior employees. Now we had\njunior employees managing junior employees. What we quickly realized was that\nthese new managers were staying late and struggling to complete their work on\ntime. The end of the day became a mad scramble. The junior employees would\noften be twiddling their thumbs while the junior managers were pulling their\nhair out trying to wrap up the projects for the day.\n\nUltimately, we found ourselves in the midst of a delegation issue. The junior\nmanagers had just barely figured out how to manage their own projects and now\nwere in a position where they had to help others manage their workload, too.\nWe issued a document and gave our junior managers some training to help\nalleviate this problem.\n\nThe document was called “Management Strategies to Alleviate End-of-Day Rush”\nand it was founded on the principle that a manager should do what only they\ncan do and then delegate the rest. As a manager, you must clearly define your\nrole and delegate nearly all other elements to keep all the cogs turning\nsmoothly. The following are a few tasks that can typically be delegated to a\njunior member of the team to help alleviate stress at the end of a workday.\n\n**Prewrite delivery emails.** Have a production team member write your emails\nand then send you the copy early in the day. We recommend that you have\nstandard formulas for most email types, as it is always easier to adjust\nexisting copy than to write it from scratch. By writing these emails early, it\nis easier to be detailed and organized. If you wait till the end of day they\nusually come out rushed. Also, it is a great way to create a “task” list for\nyourself and feel the accomplishment of completing a task by being able to\ncomplete the email later in the day with the final links. It is very important\nthat you don’t fill in the “To” and “Cc” email addresses until just before you\nsend the email (usually toward the end of the day) just in case you\naccidentally click Send.\n\n**Create lightboxes.** If you need stock photos for a project, get one of your\nproduction team members to create the lightbox for you. They could even email\nyou a link to the lightbox. You can select the photos you want and have the\nproduction team member download them and place them on the server for you.\n\n**Download client assets or upload files.** Have a junior team member download\nfiles from the FTP sites or upload project files for delivery. This is a time-\nconsuming process that can be easily performed without manager assistance.\n\n**Perform the collection and verification of assets.** Delegate these\nprocesses that include consolidating things on the server, creating “clean”\nversions of assets (such as merging key art layers, cloning and extending\nbackgrounds, and so on), and reducing assets to the proper dpi (if projects\nare Web/interactive based). You could also delegate the task of collecting and\norganizing client copy.\n\n**Start a new project the day before it is slated to begin, if not earlier.**\nHave someone on the team do this step even if this means simply getting the\nPhotoshop document open, piling assets into it, and then closing it until the\nproject launch date; this can have a huge effect on reducing stress levels.\n\nWhile it may not apply to delegation, setting a personal deadline for yourself\nto complete your daily tasks earlier than the end of day helps alleviate end-\nof-day stresses. Push for 4:00 P.M. instead of viewing 6:00 P.M. as your\ntimeline for completion. Then you can spend from 4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.\nworking on projects that are due the next day to help you get ahead of the\noncoming train.\n\nThe real trick to reducing workday stress is to delegate, delegate, delegate.\nBy spreading the production tasks across a team, everyone can complete their\ndaily work on time and with minimal stress.\n\n\n## 40\\. Why Projects Blow Up\n\nEvery year we have a project or two that blows up in our faces. The client\nfreaks out. Our team gets fed up. The budget quickly gets way too small and\nthe scope becomes way too big. Sure, the client’s obvious lack of\nunderstanding and integrity usually has something to do with it, but I’m not a\nbig fan of pointing fingers. I always look at myself first, asking, what could\nI have done to mitigate this disaster? Without exception the answer comes\nback: Don’t skip the details at the start. Every disaster project for every\ndisaster client in my entire professional career could have been alleviated by\ndoing a better job of breaking down the details at the start of the project.\nSkip this step, and you will be headed for trouble.\n\n![Image](../images/00055.jpeg)\n\nA designer often wants to jump right in and start doing the fun part: the\nartwork. “Who cares about the exact specifications! We’ll figure that out\nlater.” This mindset has caused me more grief in my career than any other\nbehavioral disorder I have. “Design” is not the first step to a project. A\ncareful, organized, detail-gathering phase is always step one.\n\nOftentimes, in an effort to achieve a quick green light, our proposals are too\ngeneral. For instance, a client approaches you about creating a brochure. You\nwrite up your proposal and happily send it to the client with a line and price\nthat clearly states that you will “Create a corporate brochure to promote\nClient X’s company.” In order to land the project, sometimes you may have to\nbe a bit vague in your proposal, which is fine. Just don’t start designing the\nbrochure until you get a fully detailed scope of work agreed upon with the\nclient.\n\n“Create a corporate brochure to promote Client X’s company” must be broken\ndown to include details like these:\n\n• Trifold brochure\n\n• 8.5″ × 14″\n\n• Six panels\n\n* * *\n\nEVERY DISASTER PROJECT\n\nFOR EVERY DISASTER CLIENT\n\nIN MY ENTIRE\n\nPROFESSIONAL CAREER\n\nCOULD HAVE BEEN\n\nALLEVIATED\n\nBY DOING A BETTER JOB OF\n\nBREAKING DOWN THE DETAILS\n\nAT THE START OF THE PROJECT.\n\n* * *\n\n• 4/4 color printing (full color on both sides)\n\n• No stock photo purchases (client will provide photos)\n\n• No copywriting (client will provide copy)\n\n• No printing (client will pay for printing directly to the printer)\n\nThis type of simple detail will ensure that you have some ammunition to push\nback to the client when they tell you things like, “I thought stock photos\nwere included in your price,” and “I actually was thinking the brochure would\nbe bigger and have 12 panels.” Without detailing out the specifics of the\nbrochure, you are left only with your interpretation versus their\ninterpretation of what the project is—in this situation, the client will\nalways win because they hold your paycheck in their hands.\n\nThis same strategy applies to all types of graphic design projects, from logos\nto brochures and signage to websites. Every project needs to be clearly\ndefined at the start to safely mitigate the chance of an explosion at some\npoint in the future.\n\nBe sure to define these items whenever appropriate:\n\n• Sizes\n\n• Concept\n\n• Features\n\n• Functionality\n\n• Wireframes\n\n• Site maps\n\n• What is included\n\n• What is not included\n\n• How many rounds of changes\n\n• How long the project will take\n\n![Image](../images/00056.jpeg)\n\nSkipping these details can spell disaster. It’s all about using great detail\nto get on the same page as the client, and then managing their expectations\nthroughout the course of the project.\n\n\n## 41\\. The Lo-Fi PDA\n\nI will preface this chapter by saying I am a HUGE technology fan. I’ve owned\nevery version of the iPod. I could write “graffiti” on my Palm with the best\nof them. I overcame an addiction to the Blackberry scroll wheel only to\nreplace it with a finger-swipe addiction to my iPhone. Suffice it to say, if\nit is made out of aluminum and has an Apple logo on it, I already own it or I\nam going to own it soon. In my digestion of all this technology over the years\nI’ve learned a valuable lesson: There are some things that are just better on\npaper.\n\nAt our company, everyone is issued a “Lo-Fi PDA” to go along with their state-\nof-the-art, hi-fi smart phone. The Lo-Fi PDA is nothing more than a fancy name\nfor a notebook. We are big fans of the Moleskine® Legendary notebooks\n([www.moleskine.com](http://www.moleskine.com)). Having a Lo-Fi PDA and a pen\nhandy everywhere you go empowers you in the following ways.\n\n**Emptying your psychic RAM.** David Allen, a renowned productivity expert,\ndiscusses “psychic RAM” in his 2000 book _Ready for Anything_. Your mind, like\na computer, has RAM, and as you go about your day your RAM fills up with\ninformation. As your brain tries to store and organize all of this\ninformation, it can get overloaded—much like opening too many windows and\napplications can bog down your computer RAM.\n\n_“Something will ‘bug’ you until you’ve clarified your intention about it,\ndecided how to move on it, and put reminders of the outcome and action in\nplaces your mind trusts that you’ll see as often as you need to and at the\nright time._\n\n_The solution is simple. Write it down. Look at it. Do it or say to yourself,\n‘Not now.’ And trust that you’ll see the option again whenever you need to\nreassess. Give it to a system superior to your mind, so your mental energy can\nmove on to its bigger and better work.”_\n\n—Ready for Anything, _2003, 26–27_\n\nFor me, the “system” he recommends is my Lo-Fi PDA. I almost always have it\nwith me, usually even by my bed. I can’t count the number of times I’ve woken\nup in the wee hours of the morning, careful not to wake my wife, and written\ndown things that were stirring in my “psychic RAM.” I quickly write down my\nimportant thoughts or the task I don’t want to forget, and because I know I’ll\ncheck my Lo-Fi PDA again in the morning, I can relax and fall back to sleep.\n\n**Speedy note taking.** I will go head to head with nearly anyone when it\ncomes to taking notes in my Lo-Fi PDA versus a smartphone. I’m not talking\nabout a full-size keyboard. I’m talking about me with a pencil versus someone\nwith a thumb-sized keyboard. As great as they are, smartphone keyboards just\ndon’t allow you to jot things down as fast as a pencil and paper.\nAdditionally, a creative person’s note-taking style is often riddled with\nsketches and doodles. It is a challenge to take notes like this on a\nsmartphone.\n\n**Drawing.** While smartphones and other devices are making strides in\nproviding capable drawing functions, they are not yet an adequate substitute\nfor a pencil or pen and a pad of paper. The Lo-Fi PDA is the perfect place to\nquickly sketch out design ideas, wireframes, thumbnails, storyboards, or even\nlogo concepts. Graphic design is a visual world; having a place to take visual\nnotes is essential.\n\n**Looking interested.** Take your Lo-Fi PDA to every meeting. By jotting\nthings down in a meeting, you appear interested in what people are saying.\nEven better, the nature of taking notes in a meeting will help you focus on\nwhat someone is saying and will help you actually become interested. This is\ncritical in client meetings or in meetings with people higher up the org\nchart. You write down things they say. They feel important. You gain trust and\nappreciation.\n\nThe Lo-Fi PDA can benefit you in many ways; I’ve named just a few. Don’t get\nme wrong: I believe in technology. But technology hasn’t yet adequately\nreplaced the good old pen and paper in everything.\n\n![Image](../images/00057.jpeg)\n\n\n## 42\\. Bring Out Your Dead\n\nSome graphic design projects go swimmingly. Some are total disasters. When\nthings go smoothly, we often think, “Check me out! I’m a total rock star!”\nWhen a project goes awry, we tend to point fingers at the client and say\nthings like, “They don’t know what they are doing” or “This client is a total\nidiot, and doesn’t know anything about design.” I’ve had all those thoughts\nthroughout my career. Heck, I think I had all those thoughts last week alone.\nNone of these thoughts will help you achieve better results in future\nprojects.\n\n![Image](../images/00058.jpeg)\n\nThe only way to truly grow in your ability to execute projects successfully is\nto learn something new every time. One of the only ways to guarantee that you\nwill accurately analyze each project is to have a postmortem meeting.\nTraditionally, a postmortem refers to the examination of a body after death. A\ndoctor will dissect the body and its organs to determine cause of death and\nmake other medical assessments. By performing postmortem reviews, doctors have\nmade significant discoveries that have led to great progress in medicine.\n\nAfter each project is complete, put on your lab coat and grab your scalpel; a\ncareful dissection of the cadaver is in order. This simple agenda will help\nensure that you are learning from your experiences and not making the same\nmistakes over and over again. Below is a look into our medical examination\nprocess.\n\n**Postmortem Agenda**\n\n• Project Name\n\n• Success Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly)\n\n• What we did right\n\n• What we did wrong\n\n• What we will change\n\nTake notes and keep a log of all of your postmortem meetings. Put them in a\nplace where everyone on your team has access to them to make sure that others\ncan learn lessons from your experiences. Dig deep and be brutally honest with\nyourself when answering these simple questions.\n\n![Image](../images/00059.jpeg)\n\nWhen analyzing the project to discover “what we did right and wrong,” be\ncareful not to be vague in your answers. Here are a few examples that present\na good usage versus a bad usage of the postmortem experience. For this example\nlet’s suppose that the project was a complete disaster. The client hated\neverything you did, and you ended up giving them all their money back in hopes\nthat you will never see them again.\n\n**Bad Usage Example**\n\n_**Postmortem Agenda**_\n\nProject Name: Bait and Tackle Shop Website\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 1\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project blew up because the client didn’t understand what it takes to\nbuild a website.\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nDon’t work with bad clients who know nothing about web design.\n\nThe above example highlights the fact that the client was clueless. Great; we\nall knew that. A better use of the postmortem evaluation would be to create a\nlist of characteristics of a clueless client and then create some changes in\nyour process to ensure that you are not caught off-guard by a clueless client\nin the future.\n\n**Good Usage Example**\n\n**_Postmortem Agenda_**\n\nProject Name: Bait and Tackle Shop Website\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 1\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project blew up because the client didn’t understand what it takes to\nbuild a website. Here are some specific things that happened that identify a\npotential problem client:\n\n• The client asked a ton of questions.\n\n• The client was condescending in their tone of voice.\n\n• The client cut the price and scope of the project three times before giving\nthe green light.\n\n• The client seemed unwilling to put time and effort into making the project\nsucceed.\n\n![Image](../images/00060.jpeg)\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nDuring the proposal phase of the project we will watch out for the attributes\nabove that can identify a problem client. If we see these attributes, we will\nhave a heart to heart with the client and make sure they are on board with\nworking toward a successful finished product. If we feel that the client will\nbe a problem client, we will cancel the project before it starts.\n\nHere are two examples of bad and good usage for a postmortem on a successful\nproject that can help you repeat that success.\n\n**Bad Usage Example**\n\n**_Postmortem Agenda_**\n\nProject Name: Car Wash Logo\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 9\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project went great because Josh designed an awesome logo.\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nHave Josh do all our logo designs in the future.\n\nIt is unrealistic that you can have Josh, your All-Star designer, do every\nfuture logo. The goal is to figure out how to replicate Josh’s success on the\nlogo.\n\n**Good Usage Example**\n\n**_Postmortem Agenda_**\n\nProject Name: Car Wash Logo\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 9\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project was a huge success. Josh designed a great logo and was on the\nsame page with the client. Here are some of the key things that Josh did that\nhelped him get into the client’s head and get to know what they wanted for\ntheir logo design:\n\n• Developed concept sketches presented to the client prior to doing design\nwork.\n\n• Called the client to discuss the concept sketches in detail.\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nWe are implementing a requirement that every logo project includes a phase of\nconcept sketches prior to beginning the design work.\n\nA postmortem review on every project that comes through your doors (whether\nthe project was a massive success or an epic failure) can help to ensure that\nyou don’t repeat bad experiences and that you do all you can to duplicate the\ngood ones. These meetings don’t have to be long or overly formal; something as\nsmall as a few minutes learning from the past can make a world of difference\nfor the future.\n\n![Image](../images/00061.jpeg)\n\n\n## 43\\. Shake the Bushes or Get Bit\n\nI grew up on a lake by a forest in northern Indiana. My wife once likened my\nupbringing to that of the Dukes of Hazzard—a comparison that was only slightly\noff. Catching snakes was a pastime for my four brothers and me. We would spend\nthe day in the forest with a can and a stick hunting for our slithering\nfriends. We were afraid of the rare but poisonous Massasauga rattlesnake that\nwe had convinced ourselves roamed the area looking for little boys to corner\nand bite. The can we brought with us was used to collect the snakes. The stick\nwas used to shake the bushes and underbrush to scare snakes out of hiding.\nWhen the snakes slithered away from the bushes, we could see if it was a scary\nrattlesnake or the harmless garter snake we were after.\n\nFortunately, none of us were ever bitten by a rattlesnake. But in business, I\nhave been bitten many times when I forgot to first shake the bushes before\nmoving forward. All too often we will jump into a project too quickly without\nfleshing out all the details. As a designer, you often want to get right into\nthe fun part—designing. The temptation is too great to skip the extremely\nimportant detail-finding phase, and instead of hitting your project with a\nstick, you decide to reach your hand into the bush, which might get you\nbitten. In fact, nine times out of ten, when a project blows up, we can route\nit back to something that would not have happened if we had been diligent in\nfleshing out all of the details at the start of the project.\n\nAt the beginning of each project, our team has a Kickoff Meeting with the\nclient. This meeting can be face-to-face or over the phone; either way can be\nsuccessful. Prior to the Kickoff Meeting, we send our client the agenda.\n(IMPORTANT: We prefill _all_ the information we know to date about the project\nprior to sending it to the client. You never want to create more work for your\nclient, and chances are good that you may have already uncovered a good chunk\nof this information during your proposal process.)\n\n![Image](../images/00062.jpeg)\n\nOur Kickoff Meeting Agenda includes the questions outlined below (again, with\nas many answers as possible prefilled in). Your agenda may be different; what\nis important is that you dig deep and ask all of the questions you can think\nof regarding the upcoming project.\n\n**Kickoff Meeting Agenda**\n\n**_Project Overview_**\n\n• What are the deliverables for this project?\n\n• What is the demographic of your target audience?\n\n• Who are your biggest competitors?\n\n• What are the objectives of this project?\n\n• What are you trying to resolve?\n\n• What factors would make this a successful project?\n\n• What concerns do you have regarding this project?\n\n**_Creative Overview_**\n\n• What are some adjectives that describe the “look and feel” you desire for\nthe end result of this project?\n\n• Do you have existing marketing materials that we need to match for brand\nconsistency?\n\n• What colors and fonts work well (or have been used in the past) for your\nbrand?\n\n• Name two or more brands or companies in your industry or a related industry\nthat have a “look and feel” similar to your desired end result for this\nproject. List their website addresses.\n\n• What are some brands you dislike in your industry or related industry? What\ndo you dislike about their brand?\n\n• What types of photos or other imagery should be used to represent your\nbrand?\n\n• What assets will be available from you for this project? When and how will\nthey be delivered?\n\n**_Technical Overview (Internet-related projects)_**\n\n• What is the server environment for this project?\n\n• Who is the technical contact on your side?\n\n• If known, what scripting and database languages are available on the server?\n\n• Does this site connect to any other websites or technologies (any important\nthird-party technologies such as Flickr,\n[salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com), RSS Feeds, YouTube, Payments\nGateways)? If so, who can provide access to those elements?\n\n• Are there technologies or frameworks that you require to be used in the\ndevelopment of this project (like PHP, ASP, WordPress, ExpressionEngine,\nDrupal, CodeIgnitor, MooTools, jQuery, Zend, Kohana)?\n\nFollowing the Kickoff Meeting with the client, we send them a fully completed\nCreative Brief that contains answers to all of the questions regarding the\nproject. The information extracted at Kickoff is invaluable in executing a\nsuccessful project and ensures that everyone is on the exact same page moving\nforward, no hidden snakes and no poisonous bites to haunt you down the road.\n\n\n## 44\\. Red Flags and Extinguishers\n\nThe term _red flag_ is commonly used in businesses to identify that “there is\nsmoke in the air, and where there is smoke there is fire.” Something has\nhappened that indicates a possible impending disaster. In graphic design there\nare plenty of red flags to watch out for. A few years ago, I got sick of\nmaking the same mistakes over and over again, and began to recognize red flags\nin the design industry. I created some documentation for our company for each\nphase of production that highlighted these red flags; each one was accompanied\nby a form of documentation to help put out the subsequent fire. We call those\nprotocols “extinguishers.”\n\n![Image](../images/00063.jpeg)\n\nEvery client is different, and every problem has its own nuances. The\nextinguishers are not guaranteed to put out the fire, but they are a great\nplace to start. The following are a few red flags that we have identified in\nour company, as well as the steps we take to deal with them when they rear\ntheir ugly heads.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client cannot provide clear\ndirection as to what they want you to do. They don’t have an RFP (request for\nproposal).**\n\nYou meet with the client. They are excited about the “big idea” they have.\nWhen you begin to dig into the details, however, they aren’t clear on what\nthey want you to create for them. If they cannot paint a clear picture at the\nstart of the project, there is a good chance that they will change scope many\ntimes during the project, causing you a nightmarish project management\nexperience.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** If you get a sense that the client is going to be a flake,\ndon’t spend too much energy on helping scope out their project for them. A\nsimple request can flush out this type of client, such as, “Client, this\nproject sounds amazing. We can see your passion behind it. In order for us to\nbe able to accurately attach pricing to your project, we’ll need some type of\nRFP. A simple email detailing out all of the elements that you want us to\ncreate will help us immensely. Once we receive that, we’ll put together some\nnumbers for you.” This approach will either force them to clarify their\nrequest or expose them as the flake you don’t want to do business with. Either\nway, it puts the ball back where it belongs: in their court and not in yours.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Sometimes your gut will tell you that the project is legit\nand the client could be on to the next big thing. If you feel strongly that\nthe client’s inability to pinpoint the scope of their project is just because\nthey need your help in all aspects (including creating the scope), then by all\nmeans, offer your help. You could get the ball rolling by saying something\nlike, “Client, we’re excited about your project. In order for us to accurately\nprovide an estimate, we’ll need to define the scope of work a bit better.\nBased on our conversation, we will create a scope document and send it to you\nfor your review. Once we lock down all the details, we’ll convert the scope\ndocument into a formal estimate.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not respond to emails\nor phone calls regarding questions about the project.**\n\nThe client pitches you a project. Everything seems to be great at the start\nbut communication goes cold as soon as you start asking questions.\n\n**Extinguisher:** Don’t be like the needy boyfriend or girlfriend who calls\nevery five seconds until they get in touch with the one they love. If the\nproject is pressing and the client is truly interested in having you do the\nwork, they’ll be in touch. Wait a few days or a week from the time of your\nlast contact and then call all the contact numbers you have for the client and\nleave messages if necessary. Then send one final email. (You have to be sure\nthat your correspondence gets to them and is not left in an email junk bin.)\nIf they still don’t reply, archive the lead and move on to hotter\nopportunities.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client requests multiple rounds of\nrevisions to the proposal prior to sign off.**\n\nIn 2008, our agency was approached with the project to redesign a high-traffic\nand high-profile entertainment website. The client scrutinized our proposal,\nand requested additions and changes to many parts of it. After a month had\npassed and eight rounds of proposal revisions were implemented, we finally\nreceived the exciting green light to begin work. Three rounds of comps\noutlined in the proposal turned into more than 15 rounds of comps during the\nproject’s lifecycle. The proposed six-month project ended up taking nearly a\nyear to complete. We learned that additional rounds of proposals usually lead\nto additional work for everything else.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** After a few rounds of proposal changes, consider adding\nextra rounds of comps to the scope of work. This way you will anticipate what\nis likely coming in the project lifecycle and be prepared for that at the\nbeginning rather than being surprised by it in the heat of the moment.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Don’t come down on your price. Stick to your guns if the\nclient begins to haggle the proposed cost. If they are asking for extra\nproposals, they will likely expect additional things during the project as\nwell.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not confirm receipt of\nproposal.**\n\nYou send the proposal and never hear from the client again. Generally\nspeaking, people are notorious for poor email etiquette, so not replying to\nyour proposal submission may not be the end of the road, but it is certainly\nsomething to watch out for.\n\n**Extinguisher:** If a client goes silent after they receive your proposal,\nthere is a good chance they are sticker shocked or have other concerns about\nthe project. First, you have to make sure they received your proposal, so\nfollow up via phone and email until you have that confirmation. Then offer\nyour desire to resolve any concerns they may have. You could say something\nlike, “Client, now that you have our proposal we feel we have some talking\npoints. We can rework the scope of the project to accommodate the budget you\nhave in mind. If you have other concerns that are keeping you from pulling the\ntrigger, let’s discuss those as well.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client balks at the price outlined\nin proposal.**\n\nYour proposal is sent to the client and they come back to you saying, “Whoa,\nthat seems a bit high!”\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Now that they have your price, you are justified in asking\nwhat their desired budget is. You can then offer to modify the scope of the\nproject to fit within their target price range.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Educate the client. Oftentimes the client has no real\nunderstanding of what it takes to execute on their request. Something very\ncomplex may seem very simple in their eyes. Spend a few minutes to explain the\ncosts to the client; a brief write-up that details the time, tasks, and\ntechnical elements involved will help the client gain a better understanding\nof what it takes to complete their project.\n\n**Extinguisher C:** Make a decision internally as to whether or not the\nproject is worth doing at a lower cost. Some projects have more than just\nmonetary value at stake. Perhaps the project is for a charitable cause. Or\nperhaps the finished product will help you enter into an industry you don’t\ncurrently service but have been looking to break into. Maybe the project will\nmake a great portfolio piece and potentially win some awards. These are just a\nfew things to consider before you agree to do a project at a reduced cost.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client green lights a project and\nthen begins talking about new features and other elements they want you to\ncreate.**\n\nThis is a sign of a potential problem client. If the scope is changing all the\ntime, you will be trying to hit a moving target throughout the duration of the\nproject.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Be sure you have a detailed scope of work listed in your\nproposal. If the features the client is requesting are not included in the\nscope of work, be sure to politely remind them that the agreed-upon scope was\nin the proposal. If they want to modify that scope of work, you will need to\nreaddress the costs in the original estimate and submit a revised proposal.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Clients that change scope are usually better off in a\n“Retainer” or “Dedicated Resource” payment structure. Explain these options to\nyour client and recommend that they change their agreement with you to reflect\nthat payment scale.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client wants to delay making the\nfirst payment on the project.**\n\nTypically you should charge some money up front to get started on a client’s\nproject. If a client wants to put off making a first payment and you begin\nwork on their project, brace yourself for getting stiffed down the road.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** If your gut tells you that you are at risk of being\nstiffed, trust it. Tell the client that you need to put the project on hold\nuntil the first payment is received.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** We have a number of big clients with deep pockets, and for\nwhatever reason it usually takes a little time to get an invoice through their\nAccounts Payable system. If you are spending a lot of hours on the project and\nthere seems to be an unreasonable delay, you have every right to check on the\nstatus of payment. Be courteous and kind, asking questions like, “Client, I\njust wanted to follow up on the status of the first payment for our project\ntogether that has come due.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not like any of the\ncomps.**\n\nThey may say something to the effect of, “These are all terrible. I’m just not\nfeeling it on any of the comps.”\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Remind the client that you have multiple rounds of comps\nfactored into the project. The comp rounds are there so that you can get\nfeedback and make changes to eventually land on the best design for their\nproject. The best thing for them to do is help guide you in the direction they\nenvision—even something so small as a font used that they like or an angle\nthat catches their eye can go a long way toward helping you piece together\nsomething that matches with their vision for the project.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Don’t let the client get away with blanket statements\nlike, “I don’t like anything.” This type of feedback is not helpful. Sit down\nwith the client and discuss specifics. Ask specific questions about what they\ndon’t like: layout, colors, fonts, and so forth. The more detailed you are,\nthe better. Oftentimes, you will find that the client doesn’t hate everything\n(and this may be a surprise to them, as well.)\n\n**Extinguisher C:** Ask the client for examples of what they _do_ like. When\nthey show you those examples, ask specific questions about what they like\nabout the designs.\n\n**Extinguisher D:** As great as you are, you may not be able to please some\nclients. When this happens, I usually chalk it up to a problem with them, not\nme. If you have not been able to hit the mark after utilizing these\nExtinguishers and have gone through a couple rounds of comps with the client,\nthey may be “unpleaseable.” Don’t be afraid to break ties with the client and\npart ways; this may include painfully returning monies previously paid, and\nmaybe even taking a loss on the project in order to get it smoothly and\nsuccessfully off of your books and out of your hair.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client wants to make changes to\npreviously approved items.**\n\nImagine that you are designing a website. After you receive design approval,\nyou move on to the build-out portion of the project. When you unveil the first\nclickable version of the site, the client makes a request to change the\ndesign. This type of behavior from a client can quickly make a project spin\nout of control. It is critical to handle it properly to ensure that a\nprofitable one-month project doesn’t become an unprofitable six-month\nheadache.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Explain to the client that design changes at this phase of\nthe project will require reprogramming certain items. This will require the\ndeadline to be pushed back, as you will need to add an additional round of\ncomps and reprogram the entire site. Be careful not to become argumentative\nwith the client, however; your tone should continue to be service-minded and\nyour goal should always be a happy client.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** In every proposal you should include a line that states,\n“Changes to approved designs during the production phase of the project\n(prepress or programming) may require an extension of the timeline and an\nincrease in the budget.” By including this text in your proposal, you will be\nmore empowered to discuss the ramifications of a design change late in the\ndevelopment cycle of a project.\n\n**Extinguisher C:** If additional costs are agreed upon with the client, be\nsure to send an official “Change Order” for formality’s sake. Additional costs\nshould always be documented for the client to ensure there are no\nmisunderstandings when it comes time to bill for the work.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client has personal or family money\ninvested in the project.**\n\nA project that is being funded by personal or family money is prone to\ndramatic overreactions and sensitive client behavior. Beware! These types of\nprojects are often accompanied with a client’s efforts to squeeze every tiny\nbit of work out of you for the lowest possible price.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** You must define an extremely clear scope of work. If an\nitem isn’t clearly spelled out in your proposal, the client may make an\nassumption that it is included.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Every effort should be made to exceed expectations. Once a\nclient with personal money on the line gets frustrated with your performance,\nit is very difficult to restore a strong, positive relationship.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not provide assets in a\ntimely manner.**\n\nFrequently you will need a client’s logo, photos, or copy in order to complete\ntheir project. If the client is not timely in their delivery of those assets,\ndeadlines may suffer.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Set clear deadlines for the client to deliver the assets\nyou need. Make sure the client understands and agrees to those deadlines. If\nyou need copy for their brochure on Wednesday, they need to know that you are\ndepending on their commitment to meeting that deadline.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** The client must be instructed on the ramifications of\nmissing an asset delivery deadline. Every day they are late will usually mean\nthat all subsequent milestones will be pushed back at least a day as well.\n\n**Extinguisher C:** A phone call works much better than an email. Don’t be\nafraid to pick up the phone and chat with your client to find out when to\nexpect the assets and to explain the importance of hitting that milestone.\n\n**Extinguisher D:** Incorporate all of the assets the client has sent and\nleave “For Placement Only” images in the remaining areas of the design. By\nsending this partially finished design to the client, they will more clearly\nsee the importance of getting you the remaining assets.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client doesn’t have an office.**\n\nWe had a client approach us about doing some branding and website work for\ntheir company. We visited their office and found that they were sharing space\nwith four other companies. They talked big and acted as if they had money.\nWhen we broke down their project, we found that they were in need of\nredesigning nine brands and nine accompanying websites. We expected that they\nwould have a tight budget, so we strategically spelled out a way that we could\nreuse website programming for all nine sites to save them money. Instead of\n$10,000 per site plus the branding work, we landed on a total price of $36,000\nfor all nine brands and nine websites. We sent our “great deal” proposal to\nthe client and they responded by saying, “Wow! This is pretty expensive!\nYou’ll have to come down on the price.” We went back to the drawing board and\nsent a revised proposal with a decreased scope of work. The new price was\n$25,000 to which they replied, “Still too much.” We couldn’t make it any\ncheaper without losing a lot of money on the job and we decided to part ways.\nWe wasted a lot of hours in meetings and writing proposals because we didn’t\npay attention to the obvious red flag: “If the client doesn’t have an office,\nthey might not have any money, either.”\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Do everything you can to find out the client’s budget\nbeforehand (see the chapter “[How to Flush Out a Budget](part0097.html#ch086)”\nin [Section 5](part0089.html#part05)).\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Send a proposal with various scope and pricing options.\nCome up with a plan that offers a low-cost solution, a mid-range solution, and\na high-cost solution.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client has an unrealistic\ndeadline.**\n\nThe client wants their project done in a timeframe that is extremely tight, or\neven impossible.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Clearly explain to the client everything that needs to be\ndone in order to hit the timeline. If the project is potentially going to\ncause other projects to suffer or create weekend or nighttime work for your\nteam in order to accomplish the task on time, you may consider increasing the\ncost of the project by including rush fees.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** The client (and you) must understand that the quality of\nwork inevitably suffers to a degree in a rush project situation.\n\n**Extinguisher C:** Explain to the client that to hit their deadline, they\nmust be fully committed to providing clear feedback and approvals quickly. Any\ndelays on the client’s side of things will undoubtedly cause a missed\ndeadline.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client fired their last designer.**\n\nBe aware that often you will hear only one side of the story. The client will\nshare stories about what the designer did poorly. What you won’t hear from the\nclient is how miserable they are to work with. Until you build your own\nrelationship, be wary of a client who fired their last designer and ask the\nquestion, is it possible that you may be next?\n\n**Extinguisher:** Discuss with the client what went wrong with their last\ndesigner that resulted with them being fired. Take detailed notes and put a\nplan in place to ensure that you don’t make the same mistakes as your\npredecessor.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: The project you are creating for\nthe client is their entire business.**\n\nMost graphic design projects relate to marketing in some fashion. The goal is\nto “sell” a specific product, service, or brand. However, sometimes you will\nbe approached to create something for a client that is their entire business.\nFor example, an e-commerce website that has no brick-and-mortar counterpart is\na red flag project. If what you build doesn’t work due to the design or\nprogramming, then the client’s business will not work. These types of projects\nare red flag projects, not necessarily for problems that will result but\ninstead because they require extra effort and attention on your part to ensure\ntheir success.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** You must have a firm understanding of the client’s\nindustry and business model. Several client meetings can ensure your\nunderstanding. Do plenty of comprehensive research to make sure that what you\ndesign and build will work in the competitive landscape.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Don’t underbid the project. Make sure you have enough of a\nbudget in place to put in the time necessary to make the project succeed. The\nlast thing you need is to be confined within too tight of a budget on a\nproject such as this.\n\n* * *\n\nPay careful attention to the warning signs in your career as a graphic\ndesigner. Recognizing and reacting to red flags can save you an enormous\namount of pain and anguish down the line.\n\nThe red flags I discuss in this chapter are far from the only ones you will\nencounter during your career. I encourage you to start a notebook of your own\nred flags and extinguishers. Reacting to the smoke is the best way to prevent\na massive fire.\n\n\n## 45\\. Brainstorms Are 90 Percent Bad Ideas\n\nBrainstorming with a group is an effective way to generate ideas. John gets an\nidea from something Sally says. George gets an idea from John. Eventually the\nteam lands on something truly amazing. When our creative team sits down to\nstart brainstorming ideas, you will often hear the reminder that “brainstorms\nare 90 percent bad ideas.” The 90-percent bad-idea rule applies to even the\nbest creative minds I have worked with over the years. In order to get to the\n10 percent of good ideas that are generated in a brainstorming session, you\noften have to muddle through the bad ideas. Imagine Indiana Jones slicing\nthrough the thick jungle brush, searching for the one trail that will lead to\nthe rope bridge and—ultimately—the lost treasure.\n\nIf you don’t understand this point of view, brainstorming can be an emotional\ndowner where you end up feeling like every idea you have gets shot down by\nyour peers. In reality, you should have the mindset that every bad idea you\nthrow out is a stepping stone to the good ideas that are waiting to be\ndiscovered. This point of view will keep your ego in check while the chaff\nthat is the bad ideas is separated from the golden wheat that is the next\ngreat idea.\n\n![Image](../images/00065.jpeg)\n\n\n## 46\\. The Communal Brain\n\nI’ve been in more high-octane brainstorm sessions than I can count. One in\nparticular, though, stands out to me. While I was working at Fox, our design\nteam leaders had a meeting with the marketing folks. Among other things\ndiscussed was a tagline to be used for one of our properties. The brainstorm\nmelee swirled around us until one of the design team members spouted out the\nphrase that would end up becoming the tagline for the next several years. The\nonly problem was that one of the marketing team members took credit for it.\nThe reality is that no one would probably have come up with the idea if it\nweren’t for everyone else in the brainstorm meeting helping to direct the\nthought line toward the ultimate winning tagline.\n\nBrainstorm ideas belong to the group. When people get together to share ideas,\na “communal brain” emerges. John gets an idea from something Sally says. Sally\ngets an idea from something Tracy says in jest. Tracy gets an idea from\nsomething Jim doodles on a scratch pad. The “communal brain” is really the\nowner of all of the brainstorming ideas, allowing everyone in the group to\nshare in the satisfaction that they contributed to the great ideas that were\ngenerated.\n\nWithout this mindset, potential squabbles can arise in a team about who really\ncame up with a big idea. While the “mine is bigger than yours” mentality may\nbe a perk to some occupations (perhaps professional sports and combat\nsituations), it is better for all involved in a collaborative and creative\nsetting to step off their soap boxes and swallow their pride. In the design\nrealm, every designer, regardless of status or ability, is better off\nrecognizing that the great ideas generated in a brainstorm meeting happen only\ndue to the contribution and collaboration with others when they all tap into\nthe power of the “communal brain.”\n\n![Image](../images/00066.jpeg)\n\n\n# Section 3: Two Ears, One Mouth\n\nSOMETIMES A CREATIVE PROFESSIONAL WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE OFF THEIR\nHEADPHONES AND INTERACT WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.\n\n\n## 47\\. The Ultimate Email Formula\n\nThe majority of our work comes from clients that are outside of our local\narea, and the majority of our growth comes via referrals from happy clients.\nIt stands to reason, then, that the majority of our communication goes by way\nof email, and thus expertly crafted emails are critical to relationship\nsuccess.\n\nEmail writing is a dangerous thing. It can be so easy for the email recipient\nto misinterpret the tone of your message, unless you make a clear effort to\ndefine the tone. The best thing to do is keep things friendly and\nlighthearted, and get to the point.\n\n**The Ultimate Email Formula is simple...**\n\n**(Message subject)**\n\n_This is the “Subject” field in your email application._\n\n**(Recipient name)**\n\n_This is “whom” you are sending to._\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_This is a friendly, non-gushy, opening statement._\n\n**(Get to the point)**\n\n_This explains the purpose of your correspondence._\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_This is a friendly, non-gushy, closing statement._\n\n**(Sender name)**\n\n_This is “whom” it is from._\n\n**(Sig file)**\n\n_For crying out loud, put your sig file on your emails! It drives me crazy\nwhen I can’t readily find someone’s contact info. Don’t make it hard for your\ncontacts to get in touch with you._\n\nI received an email from someone looking for a job at our agency. Here is the\nemail dissected into the formula:\n\n**(Message subject)**\n\n_Traffic Manager Position_\n\n**(Recipient name)**\n\n_NONE_\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_NONE_\n\n**(Get to the point)**\n\n_Please see attached résumé in response to your advertisement for a Traffic\nManager._\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_NONE_\n\n**(Sender name)**\n\n_John_\n\n**(Sig file)**\n\n_NONE_\n\nThe missing elements made the email get lost in the shuffle...nothing\ninteresting...no personality...no sig file (so if I want to contact this\nperson, I have to dig into the attached résumé).\n\nHere is that same email with the missing elements completed (the original\ncontent is left intact):\n\n**(Message subject)**\n\n_Traffic Manager Position_\n\n**(Recipient name)**\n\n_Dear Company Name,_\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_I hope you are having a great day!

This formula is required at our company, until the principles and\nprocedures it outlines become a natural way of writing email correspondence.\n\nThe best part about this formula is that it can be used for any type of email.\nHere are a few more examples:\n\n**Example 1:_Not Using the Formula_**\n\n**(Message subject)**\n\n_1st Comps_\n\n**(Recipient name)**\n\n_Sally,_\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_NONE_\n\n**(Get to the point)**\n\n_Attached are the comps for your review.

If\nthat is the case, then why do I get so many lame email messages with no\npersonality and no sig file? Carefully evaluate your personal email processes\nto make sure that you are providing your employees, colleagues, and clients\nwith the appropriate information, and be sure that any of your employees do\nthe same. Your clients may not thank you in person but they certainly will be\ngrateful, I guarantee it.\n\n\n## 48\\. Beware the Red Dot\n\n“Beware the Red Dot” is a quirky way of saying, “Make sure you reply quickly\nto email correspondence.” I have lived by this mantra for years, and I know\nthat it has had a positive impact on many business relationships.\n\n![Image](../images/00068.jpeg)\n\nThe red dot is the Mac Mail indicator that appears on the dock icon for your\nMail application. The red dot goes away when you have no unread messages. Now\nobviously, some of you are PC users and may not have a red dot reminding you\nof unread messages. But the mantra is still the same: Reply quickly to email\ncorrespondence. This accomplishes a couple key purposes:\n\n• Clients will feel like you are in the office next door as a part of their\nteam. They will get the message that you are accessible, and that you care\nabout them and their project.\n\n• Requests from people don’t stack up on top of each other that would\notherwise cause a lot of work and undue stress later.\n\nIf you are the “To” recipient of an email, you are the “owner” of the\ninformation and it is your responsibility to respond. Some requests can be\ntaken care of immediately and others may take some time. Either way, a prompt\nreply is advised. If you can take care of the request in a few minutes, do it\nand notify the client that it is complete. If the request will take some time,\nreply quickly to the client to let them know that you received the request and\nthen give them an expectation as to when it will be taken care of.\n\nNo matter what your go-to response is, the important thing is that you take\nthe time to keep your clients up to date and abreast of all project\nworkings—including any changes to previous work orders or requests for\nadditional information or progress reports.\n\n\n## 49\\. Email Black Holes\n\nI was flying across the country on business. Before I left I made sure to\nemail my business contact the flight information, as they were arranging to\npick me up at the airport when I landed. I checked my email before getting on\nthe plane to see if they had responded that my flight itinerary was received.\nNo reply. Throughout my four-hour flight I wasted valuable time wondering and\nworrying as to whether someone would be at the airport to pick me up or not. A\nsimple “Got your itinerary, Mike” reply back would have saved me a lot of\nwasted energy. My email had been lost in an “Email Black Hole,” and part of my\ntrust in that contact got lost with it. Fortunately, when I landed my business\ncontact was at the airport waiting for me, and things worked out—however, I\ncould have been spared the worry and wonder with just a simple reply.\n\n![Image](../images/00069.jpeg)\n\nIf someone is talking to you and you don’t respond, it comes across as being\nrude. If someone emails you and you don’t respond, it is not much different.\nNearly every email you receive should be replied to (aside from spam, of\ncourse). We often neglect to reply to an email because we are short on time,\nbecause we assume that the client “knows we got it and read it,” or because we\ndon’t have anything to say...perhaps because we don’t currently have the\nanswers to their questions. Regardless of the situation, a prompt response to\nevery email is critical to building strong relationships with your clients and\ncoworkers. The response doesn’t have to be (and often shouldn’t be) a long-\nwinded discourse; simple replies are often very appropriate in email\ncorrespondence. Here are some examples.\n\n**General use...**\n\n“Got your email. Thanks!” (A simple confirmation like this can put the email\nsender at ease, knowing that you received the information they sent.)\n\n![Image](../images/00070.jpeg)\n\n**Someone emails you a question...**\n\n“Thanks for the email. I don’t have an answer to your questions just yet; I’m\nchecking with John Doe and I’ll get back to you by 4:00 P.M.” (This is a great\nway to respond quickly when you don’t have an answer to a question sent to\nyou.)\n\n**Someone emails you a simple request that merits a simple one-word\nresponse...**\n\n“Done.” (We use this in interoffice communication frequently at our company to\nlet someone know that the request they made in an email was complete. With a\nclient, though, you should probably be a little more expressive than just\nsaying “Done,” depending on your relationship level.)\n\n**Someone emails you a time-consuming request...**\n\n“Thanks for your request. I am looking into how long this will take and I’ll\nget back to you soon.” (Then go figure out the strategy and time frame needed\nto fulfill the request, and get back to the client as fast as you can.)\n\n**Someone invites you to lunch and you’re too busy...**\n\n“Thanks for the invitation. My schedule is too packed with deadlines right\nnow. Could you email me back in a couple weeks and we’ll try to schedule\nsomething in?” (If you’re really too slammed to get lunch, don’t be tacky and\nleave them hanging with no reply to their invitation; most people will\nunderstand and appreciate you extending this courtesy either way.)\n\n**Someone emails you a compliment...**\n\n“Thanks. We always appreciate feedback like that!” (You might even want to\nthrow a compliment back their way.)\n\nThese are just a few examples. Use your judgment on how to reply to emails.\nPersonally, I never file an email until I know it has been attended to either\nby myself or by someone on my team.\n\n![Image](../images/00071.jpeg)\n\n![Image](../images/00072.jpeg)\n\n\n## 50\\. Even the Lone Ranger Had Tonto\n\nI remember as a little kid watching old black and white versions of the “Lone\nRanger” on TV. My older brother and I would then play Lone Ranger after\nwatching an episode. He was always the Lone Ranger, and I was always Tonto.\nThinking back on that now, I wonder why the character was called the “Lone”\nRanger when his trusted sidekick, Tonto, was always around to help get him out\nof trouble. He never really did it “alone.” As much as we might think we are\n“Lone Rangers” in business environments, the reality is that we usually have\nsomeone around helping us along the way.\n\nInformation is power. When information is shared, it empowers others. There is\nvery little information in my business that is not shared with someone else.\nMy office manager has access to all the information that I do. She opens my\nmail. She balances my checkbook. She checks my voice mail. And if the\nredundancy of the information I’m responsible for doesn’t lie with her, it\nlies with one of my two vice presidents who manage all of the inflow and\noutflow of work in our business.\n\nKeeping information close to the vest is like handcuffing yourself to your\nbusiness. It makes it so you can truly never take a break, as there is always\na place where the knowledge of others stops and you are the only one who can\nstep in and bridge that gap.\n\nWe distribute information at our company in many ways. We have an internal\nblog that is accessible by everyone on our team. Our production management\ntool is online and is accessible by everyone in our company so they can see\nwhere any project stands at any given time. We have biweekly staff meetings\nwhere I probably divulge more information than our team wants to know. Though\nperhaps the best way that we ensure that every piece of information has\nredundancy is by carbon copying (Cc) someone from the team on an email. There\nare very few emails that I send that do not have at least one other person\nCc’d on them. An email to my mom is just about the only email that I’ll send\nwithout copying someone else...and even many of those have my dad copied on\nthem.\n\nCopying others on emails has been a practice at our company for years, and has\nproven to accomplish several things:\n\n• Somebody else always has the information that you have. That way if you are\nsick or detained in any way, somebody else on the team can pick up the slack.\n\n• It presents a unified front. It says to your clients that there are more\npeople supporting them than just one, thus instilling more confidence.\n\n• Many, many, many times we have been able to go into another team member’s\nemail folders and find a lost email that saved a project or solved a problem.\n\nIt is important to note that there is a delicate balance between copying\npeople onto emails for the good of all, and the alternative—seen in the\n[Section 1](part0007.html#part01) chapter “[Drama Is for Soap\nOperas](part0013.html#ch006).” Certainly it is true that when you Cc several\npeople on an email it can appear that the information is being escalated and\noverdramatized. To help avoid unnecessary drama, be sure to include only the\nappropriate people in the Cc area. For example, a designer could Cc the art\ndirector on an email to a client regarding design changes, or the sales rep\ncould Cc the company president on an email to a client with the delivery date\nof a big proposal. Whatever the content of the email may be, there is likely\nan appropriate person to Cc.\n\nOnce you begin utilizing this strategy, you will quickly realize that many\npeople in the business world have not yet learned the importance of copying\nothers on emails. Don’t get sucked into the trap of singular correspondence.\nIf a client or contact emails you valuable information, be sure to forward it\nto the most appropriate person on your team, abiding by the mantra that “Even\nthe Lone Ranger Had Tonto.”\n\n![Image](../images/00073.jpeg)\n\n\n## 51\\. Canned Communication\n\n“There is no doubt about it: Our agency churns out a ton of projects—more than\n1,500 projects in our first ten years of business, to be more specific. Each\nproject averages about eight milestones, and each milestone requires a\ndelivery email of some sort to be sent to the client. That adds up to\napproximately 12,000 structured delivery emails to our clients in about a\ndecade. If you average that over ten years, it equates to roughly 4.6 email\ndeliveries to a client per day, or an email every half an hour or so.\n\nAfter looking into this more, we quickly found that we were writing the same\nthings over and over again. The delivery email for first comps of a website\ndesign to one client didn’t change much from the email that needed to be sent\nto another client for a similar project. In order to simplify our day a bit\nand to ensure that our messaging was consistent across all team members, we\ndecided to create what we call “Canned Communication.” This is not a\nrevolutionary idea, but I suppose the fact that I didn’t have a tool like this\nuntil about ten years into my career means that most of you don’t have it\neither.\n\nThe easiest way to start using this invaluable time-saving process is to open\na blank document in your favorite word processing software, title it “Canned\nCommunication,” and start writing the best messages you can for every type of\nemail you send to your clients. These email messages will become your template\nfor all future emails.\n\nFor example, you’ll probably have canned messages for “Website First Comps\nDelivery,” “Logo First Comps Delivery,” “Final Clickable Website,” “Project\nComplete,” and so on. If you work with a group, it is a great idea to place\nthe canned messages on a server that everyone has access to.\n\nThe trick to this is that you don’t want to sound like a copy-and-paste robot\nin your emails. Even though C-3PO was a keystone figure in the _Star Wars_\nsaga, I am confident in saying that his ability to draw people in and make\nthem feel special and unique was not on the top of his special skills list. So\nyou’ll need to have certain parts of your messages that will always be\ncustomized before you send the message out. This is where it becomes even more\nimportant that you proofread your messages before sending them out into the\nWild West that is Cyberspace—there is nothing more embarrassing than having a\nclient open up an email only to find it is a template and there is nothing of\nvalue to them at all.\n\nWe have had a few employees send “Canned Communication” to a client without\nfilling out the “Name” areas. This is totally embarrassing and, again, would\nnever happen if the messages were actually read prior to clicking Send.\n\nNot everyone works in the same ways, so you’ll want to create messages that\nmatch your tone and project types. Here are several examples of our own\n“Canned Communication” to help illustrate how we utilize this system.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00074.jpeg) **Proposal Delivery Message**\n\n_Dear [Client Name],_\n\n_I hope your day is going well!_\n\n_Attached please find our proposal for your review.

By creating Canned Communication, not only will you save\nsignificant time in your production day, you will also be confident that you\nhaven’t forgotten to incorporate important items into your messages.\n\n\n## 52\\. Tin Can Phones\n\nEver play with tin can phones? If you have, you know that what is said on one\nside isn’t always the same as what is received on the other. Similarly, most\neveryone has played the game Telephone, where you sit in a circle and someone\nwhispers something in the ear of the person next to him or her, and then that\nperson whispers it to the person next to them. And so it goes, until the\nmessage travels around the circle; by the time it gets back around, the\nmessage is often very different than the original meaning.\n\nWith the advances in technology, taking the time to talk to people face to\nface is a dying art. After all, why have an uncomfortable verbal communication\nwith someone when you could easily hide behind the beauty of an expertly\ncrafted email or text message? All right, I am kidding just a little about\nthis, although there is some truth to it if we were to really examine our\nsociety.\n\nAs designers, it is critically important that we have successful phone and\ninterpersonal communication with clients. At our agency, presentation skills\nare at the top of the list of attributes we look for when we interview\ncandidates for our team. As important as verbal communication is, we should\nnever rely on our clients to remember the conversation in the same way that we\ndo.\n\n![Image](../images/00076.jpeg)\n\nEvery verbal correspondence with a client where a decision is made should be\nfollowed up with a form of written correspondence for proper record keeping as\nwell as to ensure that we are on the same page as the client. Here are some\nexamples:\n\n• Account Rep Z receives a phone call from a client asking for a change to a\nproposal. After he hangs up the phone he shoots off an email message to the\ntune of, “Client X, nice chatting with you just now! Per our conversation,\nI’ll have the new proposal to you by the end of business hours tomorrow. Have\na great evening!”\n\n• Project Manager X and Designers Y and Z have a conference call with Client Y\nand four of his cronies. After the call, Project Manager X sends an email to\nthe client saying, “Client Y, we enjoyed the conference call. Thanks for your\ntime. Just wanted to shoot you our notes from the meeting for your review.\nPlease let us know if we missed anything!” (followed by the meeting notes).\n\nThis correspondence does not need to be lengthy. Just a quick one-line message\nwill often do the trick. Our clients often remark on our communication skills,\nwhich are high on the list of what our clients love about us. By following up\nverbal communication with written communication, you can cut off many\nmisunderstandings at the pass, so to speak, and you can keep clients happy\nmore consistently.\n\n* * *\n\nTAKING THE TIME TO\n\nTALK TO PEOPLE\n\nFACE TO FACE\n\nIS A DYING ART.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 53\\. Vicious Vernacular\n\nJust yesterday our creative director came into my office to discuss a\nchallenge he was having with a major entertainment industry client. We are\nwrapping up a ten-month long, $400,000 website design and programming project.\nOver the course of the project we have bent over backwards in an effort to\nsatisfy what has largely become an unsatisfiable client. We are on the final\npunch list and our creative director had a call with the client to review the\nstatus. During the call things got a little heated and the client began to\nrefer to the final punch items in an extreme way. Her vicious vernacular\n(intentional or not) was doing a good job of shutting down our creative\ndirector.\n\nShe referred to punch-list items as “massive bugs,” making them seem\nimpossible to overcome. My creative director considered them “minor tweaks.”\n\nFortunately for our company, during our production meeting my creative\ndirector used less vicious vernacular by referring to the punch-list items as\nminor. Minor tweaks are manageable, possible to overcome, not painful. The\nteam is heads-down and filled with positivity as they work through the final\nitems. This is the eleventh hour. The project has to get done and emotions are\nalready high. I can only imagine the repercussions inside our production\nenvironment if he would have instead passed along the extreme massive bug\nphrasing. Would we have had a revolt? Would people have been disgruntled?\nDemoralized? Even quit?\n\nSince graphic design is sometimes like open heart surgery, we need to be\ncareful how we phrase things. Imagine a stressed out and worried family in the\nwaiting room. Their loved one has been in surgery for hours on end with no end\nin sight. They wait and wait and then finally the heart surgeon comes out to\ngive them an update...\n\n“Well, John is doing _OK_. We’re having to rush to _fix_ _a lot_ of things.”\n\nThis Vicious Vernacular does nothing to help put the family at ease.\n\n_OK_ implies that things aren’t great.\n\n_Rush_ implies that there is an emergency.\n\n_Fix_ implies that things are broken.\n\n_A lot_ implies that many things are wrong.\n\nA few subtle changes in phrasing can do wonders in helping the family feel\nmore at ease, such as:\n\n“Well, John is doing _fine_. We’re having to _be proactive_ to _adjust_ some\nthings.”\n\n_Fine_ implies that things are stable.\n\n_Be proactive_ implies that the doctors are working quickly, but there is no\nemergency.\n\n_Adjust_ implies that there are subtle modifications to be made.\n\n_Some_ implies that not everything is wrong.\n\nHere are some typical words to avoid, as well as some excellent substitutes:\n\n• Instead of _fix_ , use _tweak_ or _adjust_.\n\n• Instead of _changes_ , use _requests_ , _adjustments_ , _revisions_ , or\n_modifications_.\n\n• Instead of _rush_ , use _work quickly_ or _be productive_.\n\n• Instead of _issues_ , use _elements_.\n\n• Instead of _problems_ , use _items_.\n\n• Instead of _improve_ , use _modify_.\n\n• Instead of _tight timeline_ , use _aggressive schedule_.\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“We are making your _changes_.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“We are accommodating (or updating) your _requests_.”\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“We are _rushing_ to hit the deadline.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“We are _being productive_ to hit the deadline.”\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“We are working on some _issues_ that are taking extra time.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“We are working on some _elements_ that are taking _a little bit_ of extra\ntime.”\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“The team is working to _fix_ all the _problems_ in preparation for delivery.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“The team is working to adjust all the _items_ in preparation for delivery.”\n\nYou get the idea. Be careful when writing and speaking to use nonescalating\nwords and phrases that will keep your client’s stress level as low as\npossible.\n\n\n## 54\\. An Army of Support\n\nMy first couple years in business were spent slaving away in my basement like\nGollum trapped in the dark underworld caves. But even when I worked as an\nindependent freelancer, it took more than just me to satisfy my clients. I had\nan accountant. I sometimes vended out overflow work out to my graphic designer\nfriends. My wife spent countless hours talking me off the ledge. “Me,” even\nwhen I was technically flying solo, was really “Us.”\n\nEven then, I always made an effort to phrase things in a way that conveyed the\nmessage of multiple people supporting the client. I replaced words like “me”\nand “I” with “we” and “us.” I didn’t want my client’s confidence shaken by\nthinking that they had the support of only some guy in his basement. I wanted\nthem to feel like they had an army of support. An army can win the wars that\none guy with a BB gun can only dream of fighting.\n\nAs my company grew, the “we” and “us” team-style phrasing rang more and more\ntrue; we really did have an army helping our clients and we took every\nopportunity to remind them of that important fact. Our team is instructed to\nmake sure they convey that team attitude in all their client correspondence.\nAs a result, our clients take comfort in knowing that their project is being\nworked on and reviewed by many people, which makes them feel like they are\ngetting a lot of value for their money. They worry less about deadlines and\nquality knowing that multiple people are watching out for them and for the\nquality of their project.\n\n**Replace...**\n\n“ _I_ received your feedback.”\n\n**with...**\n\n“ _We_ received your feedback.”\n\n**Replace...**\n\n“I’m _the_ designer working on your comps.”\n\n**with...**\n\n“I’m _one_ of the designers working on your comps.”\n\n**Replace...**\n\n“ _I_ should be able to finish the design changes by the end of the day.”\n\n**with...**\n\n“I’m working with _the design team_ to finish the changes by the end of the\nday.”\n\n**Say things like...**\n\n“ _We’re_ getting close to wrapping up the project.”\n\n“ _Everyone_ has enjoyed working on this project.”\n\n“ _We_ conducted an internal review of the comps.”\n\n“Thank you for sending those assets to _us_. _We_ are starting work on your\ncomps immediately.”\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nIf you really are working by yourself, I’m not encouraging you to lie. I’m\nmerely stating that you have to recognize that there is almost always someone\nelse in your army even when you are an independent freelancer. Talking this\nway helps the client understand that as well. When the client understands that\nan army is backing them, they sleep a little easier at night. And in the end,\nthat’s all the client really wants from you...the confidence that you are\ngoing to execute every small detail of their project successfully and\nfabulously.\n\n![Image](../images/00077.jpeg)\n\nAs for actual team environment, this sentiment is imperative to cohesiveness\nand unity. It is easy for art directors to take credit for the work of others,\nwhich inevitably causes frustration and resentment to grow within their team.\nNapoleon Hill, in his masterpiece _Think and Grow Rich_ , cited this behavior\nas being one of the ten major causes of failure in leadership.\n\n_“The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his followers is sure to\nbe met by resentment. The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is\ncontented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because\nhe knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than\nthey will for money alone.”_\n\n—Think and Grow Rich, _1937, 82_\n\nWe might all be better off to just remove the words “I,” “my,” and “mine” from\nour vocabularies. Clients will feel more secure knowing there are many people\nsupporting them, and the other members of your team will appreciate and\nrespect your humble approach.\n\n\n## 55\\. Friendly Updates\n\nDoctors seem to understand something that many graphic designers don’t: the\nneed for “friendly updates.”\n\nImagine, if you will, a beautiful happy family: a dad, a mom, and a few kids.\nThis unfortunate family learns that dad has a heart problem and needs to have\na major surgery. The whole family heads to the hospital together on the day of\nthe surgery. They meet together with the doctor who reassures them that his\nteam knows what they are doing; they have done this surgery thousands of\ntimes. The family sighs in relief, feeling like everything is going to be\n“OK.” Dad is wheeled off into the operating room and the rest of the family\ngathers closely together in the waiting room. The clock watching begins.\n\nEvery hour, on the hour, the doctor sends a nurse from the operating room to\nthe waiting room. “Your husband is doing great. The surgery is progressing as\nplanned, no complications whatsoever,” the nurse reassures the family. These\nfriendly updates keep the family from panicking and they continue to wait\nanxiously, but confidently, throughout the lengthy surgery.\n\nNow imagine the same scenario without the regularly sent, reassuring messages\nfrom the doctor.\n\nDuring the first hour, mom keeps thinking about the doctor’s confidence. She\nbelieves everything is going to be fine.\n\nDuring the second hour, she remains confident, but her memory of the doctor’s\nconfidence begins to fade. Butterflies start to flutter in her tummy.\n\nDuring the third hour, mom starts looking up every time a nurse walks in. She\nis in need of some reassurance.\n\nDuring the fourth hour, mom can’t remember anything the doctor said. Panic\nsets in. She starts imagining her husband flat lining on the operating table.\n\nDuring the fifth hour, mom is in a total state of hysteria. She is sure her\nhusband is dead. Her hysteria spreads to her kids. Everyone is freaking out.\n\n![Image](../images/00078.jpeg)\n\n“Friendly updates” could have changed everything for the family above.\n\nI often say that graphic design is like open heart surgery. The area of\nfriendly updates is one of those cases. Many clients freak out about their\nprojects like the family did about the dad’s surgery in the above example. The\nless you communicate, the more your clients will begin to get nervous, panic,\nor even freak out.\n\nIt is critical to keep your finger on the pulse of your projects and provide\n“friendly updates” to your clients to reassure them that everything is going\nto be OK. This is especially true if the milestones are spread out over long\nperiods of time.\n\nQuick, short, email updates can make all the difference in the success or\nfailure of a project—especially where new clients are concerned. Tell your\nclients what you are working on and reassure them that you have their project\non your mind and in your project queue. A great example of a friendly status\nupdate could be as simple as this:\n\n“Just wanted to shoot you a quick email to let you know that we started\ndesigning your logos today. We have some great ideas and look forward to\nsending them on Tuesday.”\n\nAlternatively, you could begin with something like this:\n\n“The team began programming your site today...”\n\n“We provisioned your server this afternoon...”\n\n“We’ve made good progress on your comps and plan to send them to you tomorrow\nafternoon per the schedule...”\n\nThese are just a few examples. Each of these updates will help your clients\nget back to the level of confidence they had in you at hour one. Use your\njudgment and try not to overwhelm them with details when you send them a\nfriendly update. Just reassure them that you are in control of their project\nand that it isn’t flat lining on the table.\n\n* * *\n\nJUST REASSURE THEM THAT\n\nYOU ARE IN CONTROL\n\nOF THEIR PROJECT\n\nAND THAT IT ISN’T FLAT\n\nLINING ON THE TABLE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 56\\. Deadline Ballet\n\nOne of the fastest ways to ruin a client relationship is to miss a deadline.\nYou must make every effort possible to deliver on what you commit to your\nclients, bosses, and coworkers. At times there are reasonable circumstances\nthat create an inability to deliver on a promise. While these circumstances\nneed to be kept to a minimum, when they do happen there are strategies to help\nyou gracefully dance through an uncomfortable situation.\n\n**Get others involved.** As soon as you feel a deadline may be in jeopardy,\nyou should run it up the chain of command. If you are a designer, tell your\nart director or business owner. You have to make people aware as soon as you\nknow a deadline will be missed. The later you notify the appropriate people,\nthe bigger their disappointment will likely be. Nobody likes this type of\nsurprise.\n\n**Be deliberate about communication.** An increase in the scope of a project\nis often the biggest culprit behind a missed deadline. You’ll be on a call\nwith a client and they will ask for something new; this is the moment to talk\nabout the deadline, not a few days later when the deadline is zooming by you\nat the speed of light.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a client to miss a deadline on their end. They may be\nlate in sending you necessary assets for the project. As soon as they miss\ntheir milestone for delivery of assets, you must begin a discussion with your\nclient and your creative director or boss about the deadline in question.\n\nAnother reason for missed deadlines is an unanticipated software glitch, or\nmaybe your computer gives out on you. Perhaps you are programming something\nfor a website and there is a bug in the code. These types of problems happen\nand can cause extreme delays in production. When things like this go down, it\nis vital that you communicate the problem and take an active role in finding a\nsolution. Be warned, however, that clients aren’t too interested in “the dog\nate my homework” stories. Be sure you have version controls on code and backup\nversions of files to hedge against the chance of software and computer issues.\n\n**Put your tail between your legs and fess up.** When a deadline is in\njeopardy, a message should be sent to the client. The message should be\napologetic in tone and should state the reasons for missing the deadline. Even\nif there is a death in the family, you should muster the strength to apologize\nfor the missed deadline.\n\nIf the client is the cause of a missed deadline, be careful not to play the\n“blame game.” State the facts and apologize. If you are at a point in the\nproject where you have something that is appropriate to send as is, then send\nit so the client can at least see where the project stands.\n\n**Realign expectations.** Now that the cat is out of the bag, you need to\nestablish a new set of expectations with the client. Make sure that you and\nthe client both understand the new milestones and be sure to put it in\nwriting. If it is a verbal conversation, make sure to send a follow-up email\nas well.\n\n![Image](../images/00079.jpeg)\n\n**Hit the next deadline and apologize again.** One missed deadline, and you\nmight be able to salvage the client relationship. Two missed deadlines and you\nare probably doomed. Be sure you hit the realigned milestones, and when you\ndo, be sure to apologize again for missing the previous deadline.\n\n**Rebuild the relationship.** Once you successfully complete the project,\nbegin your efforts to rebuild trust with the client. Don’t be afraid to talk\nabout the missed deadline. Discuss with them what you have changed in you\nprocess to ensure it won’t happen again. Tell them how important they are to\nyou and your business. Now is a good time for a lunch invite or another “out\nof the office” experience to help strengthen the relationship.\n\nMissed deadlines will happen. Most of your clients know that and have\nexperienced it. If you take the right tone with the client, your relationship\ncan survive the setback and more projects will likely come your way.\n\n\n## 57\\. Big Brother\n\nAbout a year into my career, fresh out of school, I was on a conference call\nwith a client. From my direct marketing agency, it was two team members and me\nspeaking with the client. We were building a website and creating various\nother marketing materials for them, and they were having difficulty grasping\nour explanation of the project. We became increasingly frustrated due to their\nignorance, and when the call ended we hung up the phone and began a rant about\nthis client’s apparent idiocy. Then I glanced down at the phone and realized\nthat the light was indicating the line was still active. I broke out into a\ncold sweat and quickly tapped the disconnect button about a dozen times.\n\n![Image](../images/00080.jpeg)\n\nHad they heard all the names we just called them? To this day I still don’t\nknow. And it doesn’t matter anyway; there is no doubt that I learned my\nlesson: “You have to assume that someone is always listening.” Think about it\nfor a minute. There are so many ways that someone can overhear you trash-\ntalking your clients, your colleagues, or any number of other seemingly\nunsuspecting people in your life.\n\nIs the phone line really disconnected?\n\nAre you sure that someone isn’t in the other room? Down the hall? Up the\nstairs?\n\nDoes the mute button really work on your phone?\n\nIs your teammate on a call with a client who can hear you in the background?\n\nAre the walls really as soundproof as you think?\n\nPerhaps you assume you’ll be safe speaking outside or ranting over lunch with\nyour coworkers. Are you sure the people sitting within earshot don’t know who\nyou are or who it is you are talking negatively about? You can’t be certain.\n\nYou have to be especially careful of this issue online. Your personal Twitter\nand Facebook posts can spell relationship disaster if used to vent about a\nfrustrating client or project. Once that information gets blasted into the\nblack hole of cyberspace, you can never take it back.\n\nI have an acquaintance that seems addicted to complaining about people. Every\ntime I’m with this person, it seems they have a new person to bash on. I\nreluctantly listen and think to myself, “Hmmm. I wonder what they say about me\nwhen I’m not around.” If you complain to one client about another client, they\ncould easily assume that you do the same thing about them. This type of\nbehavior quickly erodes hard-earned trust and can tarnish your reputation as a\ndesigner as well as a person of character and integrity.\n\nOK, let’s be honest. A little venting can be a healthy way to cleanse yourself\nof life’s frustrations. And, admittedly, some clients certainly deserve every\nounce of negativity you may telepathically (or even verbally) be sending their\ndirection. But you had better be absolutely certain that your remarks are\nconfidential, or they can destroy a profitable relationship for you or the\nbusiness you work in.\n\nMaybe the best thing to do is take the old advice, “If you can’t say anything\nnice, don’t say anything at all,” and apply it to your life at home, at work,\nand with your friends. The conspiracy theorists might be right: Big Brother\njust may be listening after all.\n\n![Image](../images/00081.jpeg)\n\n\n## 58\\. The Domino Effect\n\nMy childhood fight against boredom drove me to find creative outlets. In\nbetween fort building and forest exploration, my brothers and I spent hours\nand hours playing with Legos, Lincoln Logs, Erector Sets, and dominos. I have\nfond memories of setting up domino trails and knocking them down. One tap on\nthe first domino sets off a chain reaction that cannot be stopped until it\ntopples every other domino in the trail.\n\nFew things say to your client “we’ve got your back” better than creating a\nchain reaction. Here is an example of a chain reaction in our business:\n\n**1.** Client X calls or emails to green light a project.\n\n**2.** Immediately: Business development person sends an email to the client,\n“Thanks for sending this project to our team. Everyone is excited to work on\nit. I’ve Cc’d our production manager, John Doe, to loop him in on the project\nso that he can get things rolling with his team. I’d also like to introduce\nyou to Jane Doe who handles our accounting. She will be in touch regarding\ninvoicing details.”\n\n**3.** Immediately: Production manager replies to the business development\nperson’s email, “Client X, We are really looking forward to working with you\non this project. We will be setting up the project in our online production\nmanagement software. When we do so, you will receive a link with some\ninstructions of how to access the project in that system. We use this software\nto manage milestones and communication regarding the project. Our goal is to\nensure that you always know what is going on with your project while it is in\nthe development phase.”\n\n![Image](../images/00082.jpeg)\n\n**4.** Immediately: Office manager replies to the business development\nperson’s email, “Client X, The production team is excited to get started. I\nwill be the point person for all accounting procedures. Is there a Purchase\nOrder number that we should include on our invoices? Also, are you the best\ncontact for invoicing or should we get in touch with someone else for those\ndetails?”\n\n**5.** Within one hour: Production manager sets up the project in the online\nproduction software and Client X receives an email with instructions regarding\nhow to access that information. Production manager also sets up FTP access for\nthe client to upload assets to the server.\n\n**6.** Within 24 hours: Production manager sends an email to Client X\nintroducing them to the art director on the project. The art director then\nrequests to set up a Kickoff Meeting with the client to discuss the design\ndetails of the project and ensure that the design team and the client are on\nthe same page.\n\nImagine how Client X will feel as this sequence of events plays out. Within\nthe first 24 hours after giving the project the green light, they have been in\ncorrespondence with four key people on the team, accessed your production\nmanagement software, gained FTP access to your servers, and scheduled a\nKickoff Meeting with the art director and design team. All of these things\nwere instigated based on a chain reaction that began with Client X green\nlighting a project. The only reaction the client can possibly have is, “Wow,\nthese people are on top of this project!”\n\nEvery business is unique. Perhaps your business does not have an art director\nor office manager. Whether your company is large or small, or if you are just\na one-person team working out of a dimly lit corner of your basement—it makes\nno difference; chain reaction systems can be created for any size or type of\nbusiness. Getting started is easy; simply pull out a piece of paper and start\njotting down the sequence of events that follow key moments in your projects.\n\nIt may look something like this:\n\n**Event: Client green lights a proposal.**\n\nChain reaction: What happens next?\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n**Event: Client sends feedback on design comps.**\n\nChain reaction: What happens next?\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n**Event: Project is completed and approved by the client.**\n\nChain reaction: What happens next?\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nEach of the events in your chain reactions list should be designed to amaze\nyour client with your organizational skills and attention to the details of\nthe project. Formalize and document your chain reactions so that they can be\nutilized by all the members of your team, thus ensuring a unified client\nexperience with your company.\n\nIn contrast to all of this, few things scream, “we don’t really care about\nyour project!” more than a client green lighting a project and then having\nseveral days pass before any communication or progress is made on your end.\nEven if the project isn’t scheduled to start for a couple weeks, it is still\nimportant to keep regular communication going in the down time. A green-lit\nproject is a fire that needs to be stoked regularly to keep the flames of\nclient satisfaction and confidence burning.\n\n\n## 59\\. Avoid the W.W.W.\n\nAvoid the W.W.W.? No, we’re not talking about the World Wide Web—we are\ntalking about the fact that you never want your clients to Wait, Worry, or\nWonder (the W.W.W.). Every effort should be made to avoid these concepts in\nyour dealings with your customers and clients.\n\n![Image](../images/00083.jpeg)\n\n**Wait.** Clients should never be left “waiting” on you. If you say that you\nwill send them comps at 3:00 P.M., then make sure you send them at 3:00 P.M.\nIf you are not going to make that deadline, then by no later than 3:00 P.M.\nyou must reach out to them via email or phone, letting them know that you are\nrunning a little behind and you won’t have the comps ready until 4:00 P.M. (or\nby whatever new time you anticipate having things wrapped up.)\n\nIf you have a client meeting scheduled for 10:00 A.M., then you should show up\nat 9:55 A.M. If you’re not there as 10:05 A.M. rolls around, the client’s\nconfidence in you begins to take a nosedive.\n\n**Worry.** Clients should never “worry” about the responsibilities they have\ngiven you. Part of your responsibility is to exude confidence in your ability\nto execute on their project. By clearly communicating expectations and your\ndevelopment strategies, you can keep your clients from “worrying”\nunnecessarily.\n\n**Wonder.** “I wonder if anyone is working on my project?” “I wonder what I’m\ngoing to see next?” “I wonder if these guys understand what I’m trying to\naccomplish with my project?” These and more are the types of things your\nclients should not be “wondering” about you.\n\nClear communication is the key to avoiding the W.W.W. This includes clearly\ncommunicating timelines, development strategies, contact information,\nconceptual understanding of the project, and any other pertinent information\nrelated to succeeding on the project your client has entrusted you with.\n\n* * *\n\nCLEAR COMMUNICATION\n\nIS THE KEY.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 60\\. Be Afraid to Click “Send”\n\nHow many times have you walked out of your room thinking, “Dang, I look good!”\nonly to hear your spouse say, “Are you going to wear that? You really ought to\nchange. Let me pick out something for you.” The fact is that getting a second\nopinion on your handiwork is critical to success in every area of life. When\nviewing your own work, it is easy to overlook little details and to miss\nthings due to your closeness to the project.\n\nMost graphic design organizations are good at assigning people to complete\nproject tasks. When a project is given the green light, a designer is assigned\nto create the look and feel of the design, a programmer is assigned to build\nout the functioning pages (for Web-related projects), and—in bigger\norganizations—a producer is assigned to pull all the pieces together into a\npolished, cohesive unit. Obviously, though everyone should be checking his or\nher own work all along the way, you will not be the best proofreader of your\nown work. I’m a firm believer that at least one person should be assigned to\nbe the proofer on any given project; to be honest, the more people you have\nproofing the work, the better.\n\nNot to be boastful, but I must say I have become a talented proofer. Perhaps\nall those years of sending unintentional typos to my clients have scarred me\ninto a state of perpetual paranoia. To further clarify—proofing goes beyond\ntextual consistency and accuracy; it extends to layout and design elements as\nwell. I don’t follow a checklist or specific strategy for proofreading graphic\ndesign work, but if you are in need of improving your skills in this area,\nhere is the general flow of what works for me.\n\n**Big Picture (Take a first glance at the project; then take a few steps back\nand look again.)**\n\n• Does the design match the client’s brand?\n\n• How is the overall composition? What would improve it?\n\n• Compare the design to other projects the client may have mentioned or that\nyou used as inspiration (such as example sites or printed material). Does the\ndesign meet or exceed the quality level of those samples?\n\n• What is the point of the design? Is it trying to sell something? Tell a\nstory? Convey a message? Is this accomplished from a big-picture standpoint?\n\n• Are the dimensions of the design appropriate for the project?\n\n• Is any text the same from area to area within the project, and if so is it\nconsistent in all ways?\n\n**Broad Strokes (Begin drilling into the main areas in the project.)**\n\n• How does the eye flow through the design? Is the eye resting and focusing on\nthe right elements in the right order?\n\n• Does the visual weight of the design elements work? Is there anything that’s\ntoo heavy? Too light?\n\n• Is the color palette working? Are there colors that do not seem to fit the\nbrand or design?\n\n• How are the font choices? Are there too many being used? Too few? Do they\nwork well in the design?\n\n• Do photos and images match and support the overall design and messaging?\n\n• Is the core messaging clear? Is there a headline or other text that needs to\nconvey a different message? Will people easily know what they are looking at?\n\n**Nitty Gritty (Scan through every pixel of the project in detail.)**\n\n• Look at every single word and punctuation. Are there typos?\n\n• Are design elements structured on the grid properly? Is there anything that\ncould break the plane on the grid to add more interest to the design?\n\n• Is there anything off-center or out of alignment? Text elements are the\nbiggest culprits of this problem.\n\n• Have photos been treated properly? Have they been adjusted and enhanced\nproperly? Are photos facing the right direction? Have they been cropped\nproperly?\n\n• Is font usage consistent in the design? Is the text spaced properly (leading\nand kerning)? Is there any missing punctuation? Any widows or orphans? Rivers?\n\n• Are there any weird design tangents? This is a very common design issue.\nBrush up on your Gestalt Theory to look for these things.\n\n_As a side note, spell check is not infallible. Their are many times that\nwords can seam two bee correct, when inn reality, the VERSION or MEANING of\nthe word in question has altered the hole gist of the point ewe are trying two\nmake. This can make four a very embarrassing conversation with a client or\nyou’re boss; inn sum cases it could even cost ewe future work._\n\nThis is hardly a conclusive list, but these are some of the core elements to\nlook for prior to sending anything in for review. The last thing you want is\nto be seen as foolish, hasty, or worse yet, inadequate as a designer, simply\nbecause you failed to pursue due diligence in the areas of proofing and\nediting your work.\n\n![Image](../images/00084.jpeg)\n\n\n## 61\\. The Tragedy of Time Zones\n\nIn the early years of my business, most of our clients were in Los Angeles\n(Pacific Standard Time). My company was located in Utah (Mountain Standard\nTime), which carried a one-hour time difference with the bulk of our clients.\nAt the time, most of our team worked a 9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. shift. This\nmeant that our day was ending around 5:00 P.M. in Los Angeles.\n\nMany days included a scramble to meet our deadlines. I remember numerous days\nwhere we would click Send on a delivery email at 6:01 P.M. to hit our\ndeadline. The time difference between our location and that of our clients was\ndefinitely working in our favor, as 6:01 P.M. was 5:01 P.M. in Hollywood.\n\n![Image](../images/00085.jpeg)\n\nAlthough this strategy was seemingly working, oftentimes our clients would\nblast back a response for us to make a few minor edits before they could send\nthe designs up the chain of command for approvals. This response often led to\nus needing to stay later than expected to implement the client’s changes.\n\nOur solution to this problem was to move our delivery time back a couple\nhours. Instead of considering 6:00 P.M. an acceptable delivery hour, we pushed\nit back to 4:00 P.M. This meant we could hit our deadline and still have a\ncouple of hours left in our day to make last-minute client changes.\n\nThe success of this strategy was short-lived, as soon thereafter we began to\nsecure clients on the east coast—mainly in New York City and Washington D.C.\nThese clients had a two-hour time change that was working against us. Our 4:00\nP.M. deadline delivery goal became 6:00 P.M. in these clients’ locations. If\nthese clients requested some last-second adjustments to their designs, they\nwere often left staying late at their office as they waited on us to make the\nchanges. (Making your client stay late at work is not a good way to make them\nlove you.)\n\n![Image](../images/00086.jpeg)\n\nAll of this came to a head when we were creating a large interactive website\nfor a major consumer products company. The project had gone famously. The\nclient was ecstatic with our work and with their interaction with our team. We\nalmost got through the project without a single blemish until the day of the\nsoft launch of the project when we received this email from our client:\n\n“We never got a link today for final review of the development site. We’re\ngoing to push the launch of the site until tomorrow.”\n\nIt was only 3:30 P.M. our time when this correspondence came through. But with\nthe time change, it was 5:30 P.M. in our client’s location. Even though we\nstill had a couple hours left in our day, in their eyes, the business day was\nover and we missed the deadline.\n\nI felt awful. Our perfect relationship had now been marred by a slipped\ndeadline. I envisioned the client checking their email periodically throughout\nthe day and their disappointment growing with every email check that didn’t\nyield our delivery. Did they badmouth us to a coworker? Was their boss’ boss\nwondering where the delivery was? Would we be able to salvage the\nrelationship?\n\nFortunately for us, we had built up enough clout with the client to see us\nthrough this incident, but a valuable lesson was learned. Graphic design is a\ndeadline-driven industry. Designers, for the most part, are all used to\nworking under the gun of the deadline. However, that deadline is often\nmistakenly just a “date” and not an “hour.”\n\n![Image](../images/00087.jpeg)\n\nTo remedy our problems with time zones and worrisome clients, we strive to\nsend our day’s deliveries in the morning. Unless you are working\ninternationally, your clients will typically receive your morning delivery\nwith applause. For us, a morning delivery typically ensures that our West\nCoast clients receive their deadline deliverables before they get into the\noffice, and our East Coast clients receive them around lunchtime.\n\nEven if you are doing work in only one time zone, meeting your deadlines\nbefore lunch is a better way of doing business. By doing so, your clients will\nhave a window several hours long that ensures they will know that the deadline\nwas hit. And you will be able to relax all day knowing that the pressure is\noff for the time being.\n\n![Image](../images/00088.jpeg)\n\nMost of us learned the art of procrastination while working our way through\ngrade school. This art is often perfected in the first few years working as a\nprofessional graphic designer. The best way to ensure that deliveries can\nhappen in the morning is to put pressure on yourself to have everything ready\nthe night before.\n\n![Image](../images/00089.jpeg)\n\n\n# Section 4: Happy Head Honchos\n\nEVERYONE HAS TO ANSWER TO SOMEONE. IT MIGHT BE A BOSS. IT MIGHT BE A CLIENT.\nIT MIGHT EVEN BE YOUR MOM. LEARNING HOW TO HANDLE SUPERIORS TACTFULLY WILL\nOPEN THE DOORS TO SUCCESS.\n\n\n## 62\\. Designers Are from Mars, Clients Are from Venus\n\nJust about a year after my wife and I were married, we were invited to attend\nan evening dinner event where a professional marriage counselor planned to\ntalk about how to make a great marriage. Although our marriage was (and is) a\ngreat one, we decided to attend the “break from the norm” date night. The\ncounselor gave a great speech—funny and well presented. Like a typical male, I\ndon’t recall everything he said...merely a few highlights.\n\nHe explained to the young crowd that men and women differ in many ways. For\nexample, when presented with life’s trials, women seek to be understood and\ncomforted, whereas men seek solutions. As a result, when helping someone (like\na spouse) through life’s trials, women give comfort and understanding, and men\ngive solutions. He continued to illustrate the point that men think one way\nand women think another.\n\n![Image](../images/00090.jpeg)\n\nIronically, his time ran out and he didn’t get to the portion of his speech\nwhere he presented to the group “the solution” to the dilemma. My beloved new\nbride and I went home and she cried for an hour as she wondered how we were\never going to make our marriage work while being so naturally incompatible. Of\ncourse, I presented her with plenty of solutions.\n\nGraphic designer and client relationships are often like husband and wife.\nSometimes love is in the air. Sometimes frustrations arise. And sometimes\ndivorce is inevitable. Most of these divorces are the result of the fact that\ndesigners think and act one way and clients think and act another.\n\nThis chapter may come across like that marriage counselor’s speech. I intend\non illustrating the differences in how designers and clients think, but not\nprovide you with any solutions. In some ways this book itself is an effort to\nbe a solution to this dilemma. But the harsh reality may be that there is no\ncut-and-dried solution. However, the simple knowledge of the differences could\nbe enough to help avoid the potential pitfalls found in the natural\nincompatibilities between designers and clients.\n\nLet’s start with what makes designers tick. You likely became a designer\nbecause the insatiable need to create things fuels your soul.\n\n**You want to design cool stuff.** That is item number one and needs no\nexplanation.\n\n**You likely want to make money while you design cool stuff.** Otherwise, you\nprobably would have chosen a different form of art.\n\nPretty simple: Designers want to design cool things and make money. As a\nresult, designers spend all kinds of time trying to sell people on the fact\nthat they can create cool things. They design slick portfolio sites. They\ncreate books showing off their work. Heck, at my company we even put portfolio\nsamples on the back of our business cards as we search for every opportunity\nto show off the cool stuff we can create. We do all this in an attempt to make\nmoney doing what we love.\n\nSo what do clients want? In my experience, clients are in search of the\nfollowing types of things.\n\n**A return on their investment.** They expect to spend money to make money.\nClients typically expect that buying graphic design services from you will\nyield more sales and money for them.\n\n**Looking good for their boss.** Many of the people you work for have a boss\nor other stakeholder breathing down their neck. Their goal in hiring you is to\nhelp them look good.\n\n**Stress relief.** Clients are often stressed, worried, or confused about\ntheir graphic design project needs. They are looking to you to lighten their\nload. They just want to be able to sleep at night. They want to trust and have\nconfidence in your ability to execute on their project.\n\n**A good deal.** Clients are shopping for a good deal. They want you to work\nfor as cheap as possible. No, not every client plans to financially abuse you,\nbut plenty of them do.\n\n**Relationships.** Most clients are searching for someone who can solve these\nproblems for them on a regular basis. They want to build a relationship with\ntheir vendor so they don’t have to go through the trauma of searching for a\nvendor all over again.\n\n**Good design.** In some rare circumstances, clients may be actually searching\nfor amazing design. But in most cases, clients care about good design only as\na means to accomplishing the other objectives previously noted.\n\nDesigners try hard to sell graphic design. What they really should be selling\nare the things the client, boss, or stakeholder really wants. People buy\nconfidence. People buy trust. People buy relationships. People buy stress\nrelief. People buy good deals. If you can solve these client needs and have\nthe privilege of creating cool design, consider yourself lucky and be sure to\npinch yourself on your way to the bank.\n\n* * *\n\nPEOPLE BUY RELATIONSHIPS.\n\nPEOPLE BUY STRESS RELIEF.\n\nPEOPLE BUY GOOD DEALS.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 63\\. Let Your Client Leave Their Mark\n\nMost of your clients want to feel like they have in some way influenced the\nwork you are creating for them. Not only is it wise to let them think that,\nbut it’s good practice to sometimes graciously accept their influence.\nHowever, many designers tend to be naturally defensive about their work.\nDuring client presentations, these types of designers go in with their armor\non and shields up, ready to defend their design to the death if need be.\nWhether a client’s feedback is big or small, a battle will ensue where the\ndesigner will argue every point the client makes in order to keep their\nprecious design intact. This attitude causes problems in several areas.\n\nFirst, this approach to design defense does not recognize that the client is\npaying for the work. If they want you to try something in red instead of blue,\nthey are entitled to see that comp. They’re writing the check. Giving in to\nclient requests does not show weakness, but rather it shows that you respect\nthe client and understand your relationship—they are paying you to work for\nthem.\n\nSecond, battling every little design point that a client makes does nothing\nbut create conflict and convey a sense of pride and arrogance on your part.\nYour job as a designer is to make your client’s life easier, not more\ndifficult. If they feel like they need to argue with you over every little\ndetail, their tolerance for working with you will quickly wear thin. This is a\nsurefire way to lose a client.\n\nThird, letting the client make changes to the designs helps them feel\nownership and pride in the finished product. There is no better way to help a\nclient fall in love with the design than if they perceive something to be\ntheir idea and their masterpiece. When they love the work, they will parade\nthe design around their office telling all their colleagues something like,\n“See that? That was my idea. Isn’t it cool?!” Also, when the client loves a\ndesign, they inevitably love the person who produced the design. This is the\nway to win the loyalty of long-term clients.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that I’m not suggesting that you roll over\nand agree with every comment a client makes about your work. There are times\nwhen requested changes need to be tactfully fought. I’m merely suggesting that\nletting the client leave their mark on the design can empower them to take\nownership of the project and continue coming back to you for more.\n\nThe next time a client wants to change something that seems insignificant to\nyou, don’t get riled up. It is important for your clients to leave their mark\non the work in order to feel a sense of pride in the project. Don’t try to\ntalk them out of every idea they have; instead find ways to let them leave\ntheir mark while maintaining the integrity and splendor of the design.\n\n\n## 64\\. “Forgiveness” Points\n\nWith every new job, new boss, new client, or new project, you have one goal\nand one goal only: to build up “forgiveness points.” The graphic design\nindustry is filled with craziness. A myriad of variables will inevitably cause\na project to blow up at some point in your career. A typo may get printed.\nPerhaps a server will get hacked and disable a website you created. Maybe you\nor someone on your team will miss an important deadline. At some point in the\nlifecycle of your business relationship with a client or company, something\nwill go awry and the project will come to a screaming halt. Whether your\nrelationship with the client or employer will survive the blow depends on how\nmany forgiveness points you’ve accumulated.\n\n![Image](../images/00091.jpeg)\n\nForgiveness points are what I consider the measure of how much a client will\noverlook your flaw when it inevitably rears its ugly head. When you start a\nnew job or land a new client, you start with zero forgiveness points. Over\ntime, these points are then built up through your perfect execution of work,\nsuch as\n\n• Producing high-quality design work\n\n• Hitting deadlines\n\n• Exceeding expectations and going the extra mile\n\n• Making no mistakes in the work\n\n• Not missing client-requested changes\n\n• Building a strong relationship with the client through extracurricular\nactivities\n\nNow, knowing that you start with zero forgiveness points, if you miss the very\nfirst deadline on the very first project with a new client, the client may\nhave a tendency to say, “Wow, they missed the first deadline. This isn’t going\nwell. We need to look for someone else.” However, if you have forgiveness\npoints built up after having hit every deadline with that client over the past\ntwelve projects and then you miss a deadline, the client may be more apt to\nthink, “Wow, that stinks. But they have been so good for so long. They’ve\nnever missed a deadline before. No doubt this was a fluke and they will be\nback on top of their game in no time.”\n\nForgiveness points are quickly lost when anything goes haywire at any time in\na project, whether it is your fault or not. Examples of things that can\nwhittle away at your points are\n\n• A website server going down\n\n• An associated vendor making a mistake (a bad print job, for example)\n\n• A needless mistake (typo, forgotten request, etc.)\n\n• An argument with a client\n\n• A missed deadline\n\nWith most clients, you lose forgiveness points at a much higher rate than you\ngain them. You may have to do three great things to gain enough points to\noffset the loss of points from one bad thing. Three great projects with a\nclient might see you through one disaster project. And then you’re back at\nzero, and your client is likely thinking, “We’ll see how the next project goes\nbefore hiring them again.”\n\nAs an owner of a design agency, I have seen forgiveness points used in a\ndifferent light: as they save and lose the individual jobs of my employees. In\n2008, a programmer who had saved the day many times at our company during his\ntwo years of employment played a key role in a botched project. I never once\nconsidered letting him go. He had been “so good for so long.” He had plenty of\nforgiveness points build up to warrant my immediate and irrevocable\nforgiveness for his mistake. Alternately, in 2010, a new designer at our\ncompany had two errors go to press in his first month working at our company.\nWe had to pay for reprints on both of the jobs. This designer hadn’t proven\nhimself yet. He had zero forgiveness points in his arsenal, and thus we made\nthe decision to part ways. We couldn’t afford to keep working with him in\nhopes that he wouldn’t continue to make mistakes.\n\n![Image](../images/00092.jpeg)\n\nForgiveness points with new clients or employers take time to accrue. Stay\nfocused and on top of your game at the start of every new relationship. Over-\ndeliver and amaze your client or employer with perfect work for as long as you\ncan sustain it, because inevitably, someday, you will be at the center of a\ndisaster project with nothing to see you through but your forgiveness points.\n\n\n## 65\\. Let Your Client Be the 800-Pound Gorilla\n\nNever underestimate the power of humility or the importance of keeping your\nfoot out of your mouth. While this can be a difficult thing—especially if you\nare a designer with on-fire ideas and a killer portfolio—it is vital to your\ncontinued survival within the tight-knit group that is called the “client\npool.”\n\nABC Television has been a client of ours for years. We love working on their\nprojects, and our contacts there are truly fun and wonderful people. On one of\nour many visits with them we had a chat about the different personality\n“styles” that design agencies have. We talked with them about how we are\nservice oriented and always made an effort to accommodate the needs of our\nclients, no matter what.\n\n![Image](../images/00093.jpeg)\n\nOur contact at ABC began sharing some frustrations he had with an agency that\nthey had hired recently for a big project. He told us about how they had a\nmeeting to discuss the project and the agency people ended up doing a lion’s\nshare of the talking, even though ABC had definite ideas in mind of what they\nwere looking to accomplish. The agency execs told ABC what they needed and\nwhat the project should be without taking the time to listen first. I\nenvisioned the stereotypical agency troupe, walking in wearing black\nturtleneck sweaters and horn-rimmed glasses, their pointy noses in the air and\nsmartphones gleaming under the fluorescent lights. I also saw in my mind’s eye\nthese agency folks walking out of the meeting thinking they were so cool\nand—after they were gone—the ABC folks talking about “what a cocky bunch of\njerks they really were.”\n\n![Image](../images/00094.jpeg)\n\nThe lesson that I ultimately took away from this conversation was the\nimportance of “letting your client be the 800-pound gorilla.” Now, I’m not\nsaying you shouldn’t offer up recommendations and ideas. You definitely should\nhave an air of confidence and ambition when you present yourself, your\ncompany, and your ideas to a client. However, I am saying you should do it\nwith some humility and respect. Your clients are the people who butter your\nbread. In a band of silverback gorillas, they are the dominant male, the head\nhoncho that directs the day-to-day activities of the group. So be grateful for\nyour clients and, for goodness sake, take the time to listen to their ideas\nbefore offering up your own. You have two ears and one mouth for a reason: so\nthat you talk half as much as you listen. Take notes in the meeting to show\ngenuine interest in what they are saying. When you speak, do it without the\nelitist, arrogant, or demeaning front that designers can be known for (even\nthough your ideas may very well be better than their ideas). After all, the\ncompany they are hiring you to design for is their pride and joy; it’s their\nbaby. Do yourself a favor and hear them out—you will be glad that you did.\n\n![Image](../images/00095.jpeg)\n\n\n## 66\\. Do Your Genealogy\n\nPrevious chapters have gone a long way toward establishing the importance of\nyour relationships to the success or failure of your career; now it is time to\nfigure out who puts food on your table. Your clients and employers are the\npeople who are the Santa to your Christmas, the quarter in your candy\ndispenser, and the banker in your real-life Monopoly game.\n\nA couple years ago, I got into a deep conversation with one of the vice\npresidents in our agency. As we started discussing the history of our business\nand where our valuable referrals had come from, I grabbed a marker—as I often\ndo—and headed to the dry erase board. I began to plot out the initial contacts\nwe had in the early days of our business, and then I proceeded to draw lines\nconnecting them to the people they had referred us to over the years. It began\nto look something like a company organizational chart.\n\n![Image](../images/00096.jpeg)\n\nAs I took another look at it, I realized that it was more like a genealogy\ntree. Who would have thought that family history concepts could be applied to\nbusiness! In the end, we had five years worth of referred clients and contacts\nmapped out on the board with lines connecting them together like a\nkindergarten craft project. What that genealogy revealed to us was nothing\nshort of mind boggling: One initial contact from the early days of our\nbusiness had been the seed of about 25 percent of all total business we had\nreceived moving forward over the years.\n\nAs a whole, our company has not spent much money on traditional advertising.\nWhat we have done is spend our money investing into our genealogy tree. This\nis the list of people who have actually given us work and paid us money! We\nregularly take clients to lunch, treat them to a round of golf, send them gift\nbaskets, recognize their birthdays, and many other things to keep this list of\ninvaluable people aware of us, as well as to let them know that we value and\nappreciate them. Before you spend hard-earned money trying to market your\nservices in a magazine or billboard, first consider ways to spend money on\nyour client genealogy tree.\n\nIn order to best leverage your relationships, you must understand your\ncompany’s genealogy. Start with the very first client or two that gave you\nwork. Put them on a piece of paper, draw a box around their names, and then\ndraw a line to someone they referred you to. Figure out your client genealogy\nand then make sure you keep those people happy—after all, chances are high\nthat they are the source of your greatest personal revenue streams.\n\n\n## 67\\. Never Give Your Client Homework\n\nOver the past several years, we have been on retainer with TV Guide. Our\nstrong relationship has definitely been win-win; they need us, and we need and\nappreciate them as one of our most active and long-term clients. A few weeks\nago, we had a face-to-face meeting with them in which we discussed one of the\nbig projects our team was in the process of executing for them.\n\nDuring the meeting, I told the execs that we would need to have all of the\nproject details broken down into To-Do items, which we would then add to our\nproduction management software. Our team would then be able to work off of\nthose To-Do items to successfully manage all of the project details. For a\nsecond, the VP of the group looked at us like a deer in the headlights and I\nrealized that he thought we were asking for his team to come up with all the\nTo-Do items. He was likely thinking, “How in the world are we going to find\nthe time to break down the project to that level of detail? And even though we\nhave access to your production management software, we aren’t very good at\nusing it and don’t have time in our day to figure it out.”\n\n![Image](../images/00097.jpeg)\n\nI could almost hear those thoughts coming out of his head, and I quickly said,\n“You give us the tasks, changes, information but in any format you want.\nWhether it is a phone call, email, text message, instant message...you could\nwrite things on a napkin for all we care. We’ll convert every request into a\nTo-Do item, add it to our project management software, and work from that\nlist.” He exclaimed without hesitation, “THANK GOODNESS!” I could tell that I\nhad struck the right chord, so I continued by saying, “We are here to make\nyour life easier. We’ll take care of all the details. Just feed them to us in\nwhatever way is easiest, fastest, and least stressful for you.”\n\nAlways remember that graphic design is a service-based business. In most\ncases, your client hired you because they are stressed out and need your help;\ngiving them “homework” assignments only adds to their stress, and makes you\nlook incompetent and unprepared to handle every aspect of their project.\n\nOf course, there will be times when you need to ask your client to do things.\nIn these cases, you can try to make it as easy on them as possible by\ngathering or prefilling as much of the required information as you can. Here\nare a few examples.\n\n**Project content:** You are building a website for a client. Your client\nneeds to send you the copy for the project. Instead of asking the client to\nemail the copy to you, think about how you can make it easier for them.\nPerhaps you could prefill a Word document with all of the copy from their\ncurrent site and email them that copy with a message like, “We are at a point\nin the project where we need the copy for your new website. To make this as\neasy as possible for you, we took the copy from your current site and pasted\nit into the attached Word document. We know you are planning to change a lot\nof that content on your new site, but hopefully this will help make it easier\nfor you. Please let us know how we can help.”\n\n**Project images:** It is time for photos to be added to the brochure you are\ndesigning for your client. You might be tempted to email the client and ask\nthem to send the images they want to include in the brochure. Don’t fall for\nthat temptation. Instead, think of a way that could make it easiest for the\nclient. You could say, “We are ready for the final images to be chosen for the\nbrochure. The final design has room for seven photos. Two of the photos are\nthe ones you sent at the start of the project, which means we’ll need some\nstock photos for the other five. We have set up a lightbox on the stock photo\nsite we use and filled it with a dozen or so options. If you don’t find five\nimages in there that you would like to use, you can easily add additional\nphotos to the lightbox and we can chat them over. Here is the information\nneeded to access the lightbox...”\n\n**Prefilled bad-word filter:** Recently my company created an online\napplication for a kid company. The application had several submission forms,\nand due to the fact that it was a form targeting children, a bad-word filter\nwas required. Instead of saying to the client, “We are ready for you to send\nus the bad words you want to include in the filter,” we said something like,\n“We are creating the bad-word filter for the application. We have a list of\nbad words that we have used on past projects. Would you like us to use our\nlist? Or do you have a list that you have used in the past for similar\nprojects? Here is a link to our list...” As with the other examples, this goes\nto show that you should do everything you can to make the client’s assignment\neasy.\n\n**Prefilled Creative Brief:** At the start of each project, we prepare a\nCreative Brief for our clients. The document contains a series of questions\nthat help us get on the same page as our client. We discuss the Creative Brief\nwith the client on the phone or in a face-to-face meeting. Prior to the call\nwe fill the document with all of the information we currently know about the\nproject. Oftentimes, we’ll even put in our assumptions about the project and\nask the client for confirmation. We never send the empty document to the\nclient asking them to complete it.\n\n![Image](../images/00098.jpeg)\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of things we see in our business.\nThe types of clients and projects in your business will likely be different,\nand there will inevitably be times when your client will need to provide you\nwith parts of the project. But the message is the same for everyone: Do\neverything you can to keep the things you need your client to do at a minimum.\nAfter all, they hired you to do the job. The more you do without their\nassistance, the easier you’ll make their life.\n\n\n## 68\\. Assume That People Are Clueless\n\nOne of the best things a designer can do is assume that people are clueless.\nAnd for the most part, in this context the clueless people are your clients.\nNow I am not positing that your clients are literally mindless morons—chances\nare they are very intelligent and successful business people. However, graphic\ndesigners often err by assuming that their clients know way more than they do\nabout what the heck is going on regarding the design process and their role in\nit. Assumptions are frequently made that your clients understand how to give\nfeedback, what they are looking at, what is coming next in the project, and so\nforth; these assumptions are usually way off base.\n\nMost of the time, your client does not understand what it takes to execute\ntheir project. They probably don’t know how to give good feedback. Your client\ndoesn’t know what the next steps are. There is frequently no understanding of\nthe graphic design process at all. And unfortunately, the best chance for\nsuccess in every project stems from a working relationship where the designer\nand client work together as partners. You must understand their needs and they\nmust understand how you will work to satisfy those needs. In every phase of\nthe project, it is safest to assume that your client is clueless, thus your\njob is to teach them along the way so that they can successfully play their\nrole in the project.\n\nThere are three key areas in which your client may need your help to\nunderstand their role as it relates to their project.\n\n**Your client may need your help understanding what they are looking at.** You\nmust assume that your clients have basic computer knowledge and little\nunderstanding of graphic design elements. If you are meeting with a client\nface-to-face, teaching them about what they are looking at is easier than\nhaving to explain yourself every time you have a conversation with them about\ncomps or revisions. If you are emailing elements to your client, then you must\nassume they are clueless and explain to them what they are looking at. Here\nare some examples to help you get the gist of this mindset and how to\ncorrectly implement it into your business practices.\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “Attached are the logo comps for review.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “Attached is a ten-page PDF of your\nlogos. The first page contains all the logos on one page. The other nine pages\nin the document contain each logo individually placed so it can be reviewed\nseparately from the others. We recommend that you print all ten pages and hang\nthem where you can see them.”\n\n(You’d be surprised how many times we have had clients not know to scroll on a\nmultipage PDF. These clueless clients think you sent them only one logo and\nwill therefore assume that you are the clueless one.)\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “Here are the website comps for review.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “We have completed the website comps\nfor your review. Clicking the link below will open your browser window to view\nthe comps. Please keep in mind that these comps are nonfunctioning images\nonly. That means that buttons and other elements will not work at this phase\nof the project.”\n\n(You’d be surprised how many clients try clicking on comps because they don’t\nunderstand the static nature of a comp.)\n\n**Your client may need your help understanding what you require of them.**\nOnce they have passed the proverbial design baton to you, even seasoned\nclients may have no real understanding of what their role in their project\nentails. You have a responsibility to educate them as to the best way for them\nto provide feedback and assets, and then you must learn how to manage their\nexpectations. Failure to help them with these things can cause projects to\nblow up and can even result in you losing out on future business from that\nclient.\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “We look forward to your feedback on the attached\nlogo comps.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “To help us arrive at the best logo\ndesign for your company, please consider the following when providing your\nfeedback. Which logos do you like and why? Which logos do you dislike and why?\nWhich color choices and combinations do you feel are closest to what you\ndesire for your logo? Are there elements on different logos that you would\nlike us to mix and match (perhaps the type on one logo and the mark on\nanother)?”\n\n(These types of questions help lead the client to provide the best feedback,\nand eliminates the blanket, unhelpful feedback designers the world over dread,\nsuch as “We just don’t like any of these.”)\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “We are now ready to begin building your website.\nPlease send us assets so we can integrate them into the functioning site\npages.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “We are now ready to begin building\nyour website. Please send us assets for integration. For copy assets (body\ntext and information for each page of the site), you can just email them or\nsend us a Word document. For photo assets, you could send us a CD, upload them\nto our FTP site, or email them over (assuming they aren’t too large for\nemail), whichever works best for you. Digital photos (JPEG, TIF) are best for\nus, but if you have things that need to be scanned, we can take care of that,\ntoo. We’d be more than happy to talk on the phone to help guide you through\nany of those processes.”\n\n(Don’t make the assumption that they know what assets even are, let alone what\nformat to send them in. You must teach the client all these things when making\nyour request.)\n\n**Your client may need your help understanding what the design process\nrequires.** My team solves this by giving clients a rough overview of the\ndesign and production process when we kick off the project, and then teaching\nthem what they should expect next at every phase of the project.\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “We are excited that the website comps are\napproved and we are beginning the next phase of the project.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “We are excited that the website comps\nare approved. Next is the programming phase of the project. We will take the\napproved design and turn it into functioning website pages. The initial couple\npages take the most time, so you may not hear a ton from us over the next\ncouple days. But rest assured that we are heads-down on your project. We look\nforward to showing you some functioning pages on Friday, per the prearranged\nschedule. While we are working on the programming, we recommend that you start\ngathering your copy and images for the site. We will need to integrate that\ninto the site after the initially built pages are completed on Friday.”\n\n(Take every opportunity to manage client expectations by explaining to them\neach phase of the project. The client should always know what you are doing\nand what they should be doing as well.)\n\n**One caveat:** Be careful of your tone. The reality is that many (if not\nmost) of your clients are extremely sharp, super talented, and successful\nindividuals (in their respective field). When I say that you should assume\nthey are clueless, it is only referring to their knowledge of your respective\nfield. You never want to be demeaning to your client as you provide\ninstruction and training. You should assume they are clueless, but not treat\nthem like idiots. You have a responsibility to teach and train your naïve\nclients throughout the graphic design process.\n\n![Image](../images/00099.jpeg)\n\n\n## 69\\. Long-Term Relationship Value vs. Single Transaction Profit\n\nWhile serving as creative director for the online divisions of Fox Kids and\nFox Family in the early 2000s, we hired an outside agency to do some layout\nwork for our new style guide. The agency was highly recommended by another\ntrusted vendor, so we didn’t even get a competitive estimate. They sent in\ntheir price at $40,000 for the project and we immediately gave the project the\ngreen light. Their initial comps were spot on, and we were excited about the\ndirection they were headed with the design. Over the course of a few weeks, my\nteam sent over the content we wanted in the style guide and they flowed it\ninto the templates we had approved. Everything was proceeding nicely. When we\narrived at the end of the project, the style guide layout was beautiful and we\nwere all happy with the results.\n\nThen the agency sent over their invoice, which included a surprise “Change\nOrder” for $20,000 on top of the $40,000 price we had agreed upon! Their\njustification was that the original estimate was for a certain number of pages\nand the content we sent them exceeded what they had bid on. Admittedly, their\nclaim was true. The style guide ended up being many pages longer than any of\nus had anticipated.\n\nMy frustration was that they never once mentioned to us that they would need\nto increase the budget to accommodate the increase in scope of work. They were\nalways more than happy to lay out whatever content we sent over to them\nwithout even a whisper to indicate that we were beginning to exceed the\ninitial proposed amount of work; we proceeded under the assumption that the\nbudget was still intact.\n\nA few of us from our team had a conference call with the owner of their agency\nand the people assigned to our account. I asked about what world they live in\nwhere they think they can increase the cost of the project by 50 percent\nwithout ever mentioning to their client that they were incurring extra fees.\nThe owner of the agency said that, “Even at $60,000, the project was still a\nsteal of a deal by any stretch of the imagination.” However, he failed to\nunderstand that my frustration was rooted in the principle of the situation,\nnot in the cost.\n\nWe ended up being able to gain approval for the increased budget and we paid\nthe invoice. Guess what? I have never once considered using that agency again.\nThey sold out a chance to receive any future work for a measly $20,000. I\nspent the next couple years working at Fox—where our department had an annual\nbudget in the millions of dollars—none of which went to that agency. Then I\nstarted my own agency, which, over time, grew to be larger than the agency\nthat sent us the ridiculous change order. My agency has sent out millions of\ndollars worth of invoices and has outsourced hundreds of thousands of dollars\nthroughout our years in business. Not once did I ever consider using that\nagency, even though their work and the finished product were excellent.\n\nThis situation may sound like it’s got a bit of vindictiveness on my part, but\nknow that I’m not a spiteful person; it was the lack of business tact in the\ndelivery of the change order that I didn’t appreciate. It seems this agency\ndidn’t understand that in business, a long-term relationship typically has\nmore value than any profits a single transaction may generate.\n\nRecently, we had a new client approach us to do some work. This client shared\nwith us a few stories about how he had been burned by change orders from his\nprevious agency. His biggest complaint was that they never charged what they\ncommitted in their proposal. Every invoice included extra change fees and\nadditional charges. We, of course, promised that this would not be the case\nwith us. However, in order to ensure that our clients know they will never be\nsurprised by our agency, we added the following term to our proposal.\n\n_“The Client shall be responsible for making additional payments for changes\nrequested by the Client that are outside the original assignment. An estimate\nfor these additional charges will be approved by the Client before any work is\ndone. No additional payment shall be made for changes required to conform to\nthe original assignment description.”_\n\nUnfortunately, the graphic design and advertising world is filled with people\nwho charge extra fees that were not agreed upon by the client. This\nrelationship-damaging practice is a detriment to your career growth.\n\n\n## 70\\. Oddities at the Start Mean Oddities at the End\n\nA few years after starting my company, we were approached by a client to\ncreate an interactive entertainment website. The project was big, and it was\nright up our alley. After all, we work with clients like Disney, Warner Bros.,\nFox, Sony, and such. We were a great choice for them, and our whole team was\nexcited about the prospect. We sent our first estimate, just shy of $300,000,\nto get things rolling. Although they ended up green lighting a much lower\nprice due to scope revisions, there was no sticker shock with the initial\nproposal. Moreover, the client was an advertising agency, and we were\nconvinced this was going to be a great project. How could they be a bad client\nwhen they walk in our shoes every day? We expected nothing but smooth sailing\nand a successful working relationship.\n\nThen the oddities started. Just before they officially signed off on the\nproposal, the agency asked us to complete a personality test for everyone on\nour team. They claimed they wanted to know who they were working with and—in a\ncondescending manner—made us feel like this was commonplace with the big “ad\nagencies.” We humbly agreed to complete their personality test and admittedly\nfelt like we were out of the loop. “I guess all the big ad agencies make their\nvendors complete personality tests prior to working together,” we thought.\nThey sent over the tests in PDF format and our team members began choosing\nadjectives in a series of rows and columns to define their personality in the\nworkplace. We sent the completed tests back to the client and anxiously\nawaited the results.\n\nThey were pleased that our agency had a good mix of personality types. Each\nemployee had been categorized into four personality buckets. We had fun at our\noffice finding out the results and teasing each other about our respective\npersonalities. The client began asking questions about how the project would\nbe run in our shop and who would be working on things on our side. We wanted\nan all-star team on the project and told them we would have our art director\nrun point. He was our best project manager, and all of our clients loved\nworking with him. They replied that they didn’t want him to work on the\nproject because he wasn’t the right type of personality. (Keep in mind, they\nhad never once met him or spoken with him in person or otherwise.) They wanted\nsomeone else from our team to manage the project on our side. This should have\nbeen a _huge_ red flag that this client relationship was going to be a\ndisaster.\n\n* * *\n\nODD BEHAVIOR\n\nAT THE START OF A PROJECT\n\nIS ALMOST ALWAYS\n\nGOING TO YIELD\n\nMORE ODD BEHAVIOR\n\nDURING AND AT THE END\n\nOF THE PROJECT.\n\n* * *\n\nWe had seen our art director manage hundreds of projects during his few years\nwith our company. We knew he was the man for the job. But we caved. We let\nthem tell us how to run our company based on a five-minute personality survey.\nWe assigned the person they chose to be the lead on the project. He wasn’t an\nawful choice by any means, but he did not have the same level of project\nmanagement skills as our art director.\n\nWe kicked off the project and got to work. The next eight months were filled\nwith nothing but turmoil. The client revised the scope three times after\nkickoff. They were not willing to pay us for pieces of the project they\ncancelled after we began working on them. We had weekly phone calls, mostly\nasking them for assets that were almost always late. And in the end, they made\na request to cut the entire project in half. We jumped through hoop after hoop\nin an effort to accommodate this client. Finally, we had enough and made the\ndecision to part ways as amicably as possible.\n\nIn retrospect, the odd behavior exhibited at the start of the project should\nhave been a crystal ball for us. We should have had some backbone and made\nsure we ran our business as we knew how. What kind of client thinks they can\ntell you how to run your business based on a five-minute personality test?\n\nThe moral of this bizarre but true story is that too often we as designers are\ntoo accommodating for our clients. Odd behavior at the start of a project is\nalmost always going to yield more odd behavior during and at the end of a\nproject. The best thing to do is take charge of the project from the very\nstart and not be afraid to pass on a project if it appears it may be a\nheartache down the road.\n\n\n## 71\\. Don’t Be the Desperate Girlfriend\n\nThink back to high school. Remember the girl or guy who seemed “unattainable?”\nYou know, the one everyone seemed to have a crush on? I am willing to bet that\nthere was never a time when that person came across as being “desperate.” On\nthe contrary, that person probably seemed perfectly happy and confident with\nor without your adoration. I’m not a psychologist, but perhaps this lack of\ndesperation is one of the attributes that made this person so desirable.\n\nAs a freelancer or agency owner, keeping business coming in is an ongoing\nactivity. If you want to be successful, it is imperative that you have at\nleast a few clients who provide regular work to your business. “Selling” to\nthese clients should be first on your list of priorities. The challenge is\napproaching them with the right message.\n\nIf you come right out and ask for work, you could appear desperate. I have\nstooped to this level only once in my career (so far). It was in the height of\nthe recession in 2009. NBC Universal was our biggest client from the previous\nyear and they hadn’t sent one project to us in 2009. Along with the rest of\nthe service-oriented businesses in the world, we were nervous and getting\ndesperate. I sent an instant message to my closest contact at NBC and said,\n“I’m unabashedly messaging you to try to drum up work. Got anything?” I didn’t\nmind looking desperate to this contact and knew that our relationship could\ntake it. Unfortunately, we don’t have this type of open relationship with all\nour clients and a little more tact is advised when looking to generate\nbusiness.\n\nThe most successful way we’ve found to ask for work without actually “asking”\nfor work is a simple message to a client:\n\n“We were just reviewing our production schedule for the next quarter. We’ve\nreally enjoyed working on projects with you and are curious as to what your\nplans are for next quarter. Please let us know what you see on the horizon\nwhen you get a free moment. We want to make sure we have production bandwidth\navailable for you as the need arises.”\n\n(Obviously, this message should be customized to fit your tone and timing.\nInstead of “next quarter,” you may ask about the next “week,” “month,” or\n“year.”)\n\nThe goal of this message is to get an idea of what your client may have coming\nyour way. It also serves as a friendly reminder that you exist and that you\nare ready and willing to help them when they need you. Essentially, it is a\ngood way to try to drum up work without acting like a desperate sixteen-year-\nold looking for a date to the prom.\n\n![Image](../images/00100.jpeg)\n\n\n## 72\\. Stand in Manure, Smell Like Manure\n\nInevitably there will come a day when you will find yourself standing in a\npile of manure. The longer you stand in the manure, the more you will begin to\nstink. It makes no difference whether it is your manure or not; the fact is\nthat you are knee deep in it and you will begin to reek of it.\n\nSometimes projects go south. It doesn’t matter how great a project manager you\nare, there will come a time over the course of your graphic design career when\nyou find yourself knee deep in a disaster of a project. It could be your\nfault. It could be your client’s fault. Perhaps it is even a third party’s\nfault. Where the fault lies doesn’t make any difference—what matters is that\nthe project is off track, your client is frustrated, and you are guilty by\nassociation. As a result, everyone begins to smell. To you, your client reeks\nof manure. In the eyes of your client, your stench is unbearable. All parties\ninvolved are frustrated with each other and this is difficult to recover from.\n\nA good friend of mine runs a small design agency in Tennessee. It seems he\ncalls me about once a quarter to pick my brain on an issue he is dealing with.\nOn one particular occasion, he was waist high in a manure pile.\n\nHis company had built an online game for Fox’s hit show, “American Idol.” The\ngame was working great and ready to go live. The only problem was integration\nof the banner ads into the Flash game: The banner ad company provided ad code\nto the client. The client sent the code to my friend’s programmers. My\nfriend’s programmers put it in the game. It didn’t work. My friend told the\nclient there was a problem with the banner ad code. The banner ad company told\nthe client that there was a problem with the game.\n\nI’m sure the client didn’t know whom to believe. And it really didn’t matter\nwho was at fault. Both my friend’s company and the banner ad company looked\nbad. And to top it all off, the client looked bad too. Everyone involved was\nstanding in manure. In the end, my friend’s team figured out the problem, got\neverything working, and saved the day, but it was too late. They were now\nassociated with a disaster project; the smell of manure had seeped into their\npores, and to the client, they smelled worse than a pig farm on a hot summer’s\nday. I doubt that client will be hiring a stinky vendor anytime soon.\n\n![Image](../images/00101.jpeg)\n\nHere are a few keys to keeping yourself and your company smelling like roses.\n\n**Avoid manure.** Communication is the key to avoiding manure. Make sure your\nclient always knows where you stand on projects, what challenges you are\nconfronting, when they will be seeing things, and so forth. If there are third\nparties involved, make sure you have their contact info from the start of the\nproject. That way, if something goes awry, you can communicate directly with\nthe third party involved instead of using the client as a middleman.\n\n**Get out of manure fast.** If you have a project that goes haywire, don’t\ndelay getting back on track. View your client as a partner in the process and\ncontact them as soon as you realize you are in manure. Explain the situation\nand ask them, “What can we do to get things rolling smoothly again?” Effective\ncommunication can get you out of a manure pile better than anything else.\n\n**Send your client some soap.** I didn’t have to grow up on a farm to know\nthat soap helps when you smell like manure. If you have a project that has\ngone amuck and your client is getting smelly, there is a good chance that you\nare getting smelly, too. Soap is the best way to clean off the stink. The kind\nof soap I’m talking about is something that presents an added benefit for the\nclient. For example, you could add some new features to the project.\nDiscounting pricing always helps put you in a good light, as well. You could\nalso send a gift of some kind to the client. Be creative and do what is\nappropriate.\n\nKnow that when a project goes bad, whether it is your fault or not, you look\nbad and need to take drastic measures if necessary to begin smelling sweetly\nonce again.\n\n* * *\n\nYOU ABSOLUTELY\n\nHAVE A RIGHT\n\nTO FIRE YOUR CLIENT.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 73\\. Never Fire a Client?\n\nI’ll start this chapter by saying that you absolutely have a right to fire\nyour client. But the lesson taught to me by one of my first bosses merits some\nconsideration.\n\nWhile living in Arizona, I worked at a direct marketing agency. The company\nstruggled financially and the leadership was questionable at times. But I did\nlearn a few lessons while enduring my time there. In a discussion about how to\nwork with a difficult client, the president of the company offered up this\nadvice.\n\n_“Never fire a client. Just raise the price on them. Then they will either be\nspending so much with you that they will be worth the pain they inflict on\nyou, or they will not agree to pay the higher prices and they’ll leave on\ntheir own. Either way, you win.”_\n\nCertainly this advice is worth considering. We’ve tried it a couple times with\nmixed results. In some cases, the client pays the higher fees. In other cases,\nthey go away. And in other instances, the client gets frustrated.\n\nMost of our production team members do some freelance work, and they sometimes\noutsource work to each other. In one case, one of our current programmers\nasked one of our ex-programmers for a price quote to do some work for him on a\nsmall freelance job. The ex-programmer came back with an estimate that, when\nbroken down into an hourly rate, amounted to $1,000 per hour. Our current\nprogrammer who requested the estimate was frustrated and exclaimed, “If you\ndon’t want to do the work, just say so! Don’t send an insulting price.”\n\n![Image](../images/00102.jpeg)\n\nThis is the only way the “Never Fire a Client” advice can backfire, so be\ncareful when you follow it. It is definitely not applicable to every scenario.\nSometimes it is just better to say “no thanks” to a client than to go through\nthe frustration and turmoil that can come down the pike later. If the client\nis one you have had for some time, you will have to take that relationship\ninto consideration, as it is likely that more is at stake than just their\ncurrent business with you (such as potential referrals or bigger, better jobs\ndown the road that may make working with them more worthwhile than it is\ncurrently).\n\n![Image](../images/00103.jpeg)\n\n\n## 74\\. “We Decided to Go Another Direction” Means “You Suck”\n\nYou put your heart and soul into a proposal. Sometimes you even fly out to see\nthe client and make a fancy pitch. In the end, there are times when you are\nnot selected to do the work. The client tries to let you down easily by\ntelling you, “We decided to go in another direction.” If I had a dollar for\nevery time I heard that phrase, I’d be a rich man. We’ve learned to interpret\nwhat the client really means when they say it: “You suck, and we’re just\ntrying to let you down easy.”\n\nAt the start of my business when we would hear that from clients, we would\nsimply say, “Thanks for considering us. Please let us know if we can help you\nout in the future.” Then we’d sit and speculate as to why we weren’t chosen to\ndo the work.\n\n![Image](../images/00104.jpeg)\n\nSpeculation is healthy and can lead to improvement. However, nothing will help\nyou land the next project with that client better than reacting to the facts.\nAnd to get the facts, you have to ask.\n\n“Thanks for considering us. It was a pleasure putting the proposal together\nfor you. We are always looking to improve our business and are curious as to\nwhat the determining factors were for your choice. Was our price too high?\nDoes the agency you chose have more applicable experience? Any feedback would\nbe very appreciated so that we can prepare ourselves to serve you better in\nthe future. Thanks!”\n\nYou likely put several hours into trying to land the project, so you have a\nright to know why you weren’t chosen. If the client truly considers you a\nviable resource for future projects, they will answer your questions. Your\ndesire to improve your business and react positively to their feedback will\nalso be a feather in your cap, as the client will see your dedication.\n\nThese are the most common reasons you will not win a proposal:\n\n**Price.** Far too often, clients make their choice based completely on price.\nIf you have a budget range from the client and you know they are sending out\nthe project for bid, be sure you are on the low end of the budget so that this\nfactor does not play a part in their decision. If you don’t know a budget\nrange, for some ideas see the chapter titled “[How to Flush Out a\nBudget](part0097.html#ch086)” in [Section 5](part0089.html#part05).\n\n**Confidence.** Another determining factor is confidence. The client simply\nbelieves that someone else is more equipped to handle the job. This could be\nbased on company size. It could be based on related experience. It could also\nbe based on a gut feeling. But nothing makes you feel like you suck more than\nsomeone else being chosen because they are deemed to be more capable.\n\n**Relationship.** Our focus on creating relationships has won us numerous\nprojects. On the flip side, we have also lost many projects due to not having\na strong relationship with the client. There are times where a request for\nproposal is sent out with the sole intention of reinforcing a decision to go\nwith their preselected Vendor X. Your proposal is compared to that of the\npreselected vendor and everyone in the room says, “See, we absolutely should\ngo with Vendor X.” In these instances, the client may not even reply to your\ninquiry about why you were not chosen. (Come to think of it, in most of these\ncases the client doesn’t even reply to your proposal delivery message.) You\nhave simply been a pawn in their little game. When all other things are equal,\nthe client will choose the person they have the best relationship with almost\nevery time.\n\n**Interest Level.** One time when we lost a project to another agency, we\nasked the client why they decided to go in another direction. Their response\nwas disheartening to us. “You guys had a great portfolio. Your price was right\non target. It’s just that some of the other agencies showed more interest in\nour project. So we decided to go with one of them.” In other words, we failed\nto express enough enthusiasm to win the job. In order to land work, you must\nshow genuine excitement for the client’s project. Your passion will be\ninfectious and help the client feel your willingness to go the extra mile for\nthem.\n\nDon’t just roll over and be abused by potential clients who don’t choose you.\nDo everything in your power to improve your bidding process by asking the\nclient for simple feedback as to why you were not selected. They owe you that.\n\n\n## 75\\. There Are Such Things as Stupid Questions\n\nWith most of my company’s clients located in a different state than where I\nreside, I do a bit more than my fair share of traveling. One of my favorite\nplaces to visit is New York City. I absolutely love the energy in that great\ncity, and I delight in exploring all of the great places to eat. On a side\nnote, if you have never been to the New York area’s Junior’s restaurants, do\nyourself a favor and add them to your list of “must eat” places. No need to\nlook at the menu at the Times Square spot; order “Something Different”\n(featuring a pile of juicy brisket sandwiched between two potato pancakes\ntopped with gravy and applesauce...mmmmmmmmm...) and then polish it off with a\nslice of delectable “Devil’s Food Cheesecake.”\n\nDuring a recent trip, my family and I were “enjoying” questionable service at\nanother Times Square restaurant (not my beloved Junior’s). Once I realized\nthat our service level was in question, I became hypersensitive to our\nserver’s performance. After an overly long wait, she dropped off our food and\nwalked past the table next to us. Surprisingly, she noticed that this guest’s\nDiet Coke was empty. He still had over half of his food left to finish so she\nasked, “Would you like a refill?”\n\n![Image](../images/00105.jpeg)\n\nPerhaps you might consider this adequate service. I, however, considered this\nan obvious question and a missed opportunity. “OF COURSE, he would like a\nrefill!” I thought. “He still has half his food left to eat and nothing to\nwash it down with!” Had she brought him a brand new drink without asking\nfirst, I am certain he would have appreciated her service all the more. Or at\nthe least, so he’d have the opportunity to respond she could have told him her\nplan to replenish his soda in advance, saying “I’m going to grab a refill of\nyour drink, I’ll be back in a second. Need anything else?”\n\nBeing a graphic designer, like being a waiter (and countless other service-\noriented professions), is a career path that is filled with opportunities to\nanticipate the needs of your customers and fill them without asking obvious\nquestions.\n\nFor example, a client comes to your office and spends 45 minutes talking to\nyou about their company. You can tell that their voice is getting a little\nscratchy. Don’t ask them if they want some water; find an opportune moment to\ninterject and say, “Just a minute, let me grab a water for you.” (We have a\nmini-fridge in our conference room that is always stocked with handy beverages\nfor this very reason.)\n\nOr perhaps you are talking with a new client. You are excited about the new\nproject and ready to get rolling. Don’t ask them questions like, “Are you in a\nhurry to start this project?” (Nine times out of ten they are in a rush.)\n\nInstead, tell them, “I’m sure you are anxious to get this project going. Here\nis how the production schedule will play out...”\n\nLikewise, imagine you are at the end of the design phase of a website project\nand ready to start programming, but the client has a few final tweaks. Don’t\nask them, “Would you like us to make your changes to the comps and send you a\nrevised version? Or, would you like us to just implement the changes when we\nbuild out the site?”\n\nInstead take the initiative and say, “We’ve taken detailed notes of these\nchanges. Since they are minor, we’ll just plan on making them when we build\nout the functioning website pages.”\n\nIt is always better to anticipate your client’s needs and proactively present\nyour plan to satisfy those needs than it is to ask your client stupid\nquestions. Not only will it save you potential embarrassment, but it will set\nyou up to be a hero in your client’s eyes.\n\n\n## 76\\. You Can’t Get Mad at Math\n\nWe are nearing the end of a two-month long remodel of the main floor of our\nhome. My wife pulled a thread that led to tearing out walls, rerouting\nplumbing, and redoing electrical. Destruction, dust, and debris are slowly\nmanifesting into a beautiful new kitchen, foyer and family room that our\nfamily is looking forward to enjoying. We have learned many lessons throughout\nthe process, one of which is that you can’t get mad at math. Two plus two\nequals four every time. There is no denying it. There is no arguing with it.\n\nWhen it came time to refinish our hardwood floors during this process, our\ncontractor told us that we would need to be out of the home for 24 hours while\nthe floors dried. As much as we would have preferred not to have the\ndisruption in our lives, there was no denying the fact that it takes 24 hours\nfor the finish to cure. The numbers are the numbers.\n\nAt the end of the process, I received the final invoice from the contractor.\nIt was several thousand dollars more than expected. I knew we had made plenty\nof extra requests along the way; I just didn’t know what the final costs of\nthose requests would be. Each item was itemized in detail:\n\n• Custom wood floor vents $100 each × 6 = $600\n\n• Replace silver hinges on all doors $35 × 5 = $175\n\n• Add crown molding to living room $350\n\n• Assist kitchen cabinet installers 2 hours @ $65/hour = $130\n\n• Etc.\n\nWhile reviewing the itemized list of requests, services, and hours, it became\nclear that we owed the full amount and my initial sticker shock dissipated.\nThe math was the math. There was no arguing with it. There was no getting mad\nat it. Explaining the math behind a production request can often diffuse an\notherwise emotional situation.\n\nSome time ago, our agency had a retainer with TD Ameritrade. We had created\nsome branding elements, marketing materials, and presentations during the\ncourse of the retainer. Our design team created one of the PowerPoint decks\nthat was an astonishingly large 1,820 pages. The production cycle had lasted a\nfew weeks and the team was one day away from completion of the final document\nwhen an unwelcome request came in from the client. “Can you change...” They\nhad asked for a global change to the design style that would require\nmodifications on all 1,820 pages.\n\nCharged with emotion and fear, our lead designer came to me in a panic, “This\nis going to take forever! What do we say to them? We don’t want them to get\nmad if we say we can’t do it. We don’t want to stay up all night for the next\ncouple nights to get this finished.” I explained to her this math principle\nand together we crafted a “you can’t get mad at math” email to the client.\n\n_Joe,_\n\n_We are excited to be wrapping up this project. We’re all proud of the work\ncompleted._\n\n_Thank you for the change request. We understand that design changes happen,\nand we know that there are a lot of decision-makers that you are striving to\nplease._\n\n_Needless to say, this is a big request and we have very little time left.\nYour requested change will need to be made to all 1,820 slides in the\npresentation. If we work as fast as possible and have no glitches along the\nway, we might be able to complete it in 30 seconds per slide. That totals\n54,600 seconds (or 910 minutes or 15 hours). We have only three business hours\nleft before the deadline. We just don’t see how we can accommodate this\nrequest and retain a high level of quality in the process. We hope you\nunderstand._\n\n_We look forward to your response._\n\n_Thanks!_\n\n_Janet_\n\nOff the email went and we eagerly awaited the clients reaction. Within just a\nfew minutes they replied, “We understand it is big request and the timeline is\ntight. Thank you for your explanation. Do what you can.”\n\nThere was no anger. They weren’t upset with us. The math was the math, and\nspelling it out for them helped them see things our way. We made as many\nchanges as we could within the time available and the client was satisfied\nwith our efforts.\n\nOftentimes, a client or boss does not understand what really goes on behind\nthe scenes in a project. Many people seem to think that Adobe created a magic\n“Make Website” button and out pops amazing comps. When requests come in that\nseem unreasonable, give a mathematical response a try. It may just diffuse an\nemotional time bomb.\n\n\n## 77\\. You Have 65 Seconds to Land a Job\n\nA design student at a local university approached me once and asked for some\ntips. This student was graduating soon and was preparing to begin spamming out\nrésumés. We receive an enormous amount of resumes from people wanting to work\nat our agency. I offered the student a little advice on our unofficial\nprocess: You have about 65 seconds to land a job.\n\n**1st:** We skim the email letter; hopefully it is custom written for our\nagency. (Takes about 5 seconds.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**2nd:** We look at the résumé; hopefully we will find a PDF attached. Is it\nnicely designed? Is there a custom logo? Did they pay attention to typography?\n(Takes about 10 seconds.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**3rd:** We actually read the résumé, looking for buzzwords of skills and\nexperience that we feel would add value to our business. (Takes about 20\nseconds.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**4th:** We look for a link to a website portfolio. We want to see digital\nsamples online with a custom domain name. We’re not a fan of email-attachment\nsamples or generic online gallery templates. (Takes about 30 seconds to 1\nminute.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n![Image](../images/00106.jpeg)\n\n**5th:** We look for salary requirements in the cover letter or email. If we\ndon’t find them we ask our office manager to email the candidate to ask for a\nsalary range.\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**6th:** We ask our office manager to set up an interview and we flag the\ncandidate’s email to help us remember them.\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**7th:** We have an interview.\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**8th:** The candidate gets a job!\n\nI assume that the way we plow through the onslaught of résumés coming to our\nagency is not dissimilar to most other agencies. So take care in writing a\ncustom email, preparing your résumé, and creating an eye-catching portfolio\nwebsite. You likely have only a few seconds of the hiring manager’s time, so\nmake them count!\n\n\n## 78\\. How to Ask for a Raise Without Asking for a Raise\n\nI’ve asked for a raise only once in my career, and in retrospect, I was an\nidiot for doing so. The company I was with was struggling. The board of\ndirectors had just ousted the CEO, and one of the board members had been put\nin charge. Like a junior-minded, brainless employee, I decided that I should\ngo plead my case as to why I felt I should be earning more money. The new\ncompany head heard my case and took it under consideration. A few short weeks\nlater, I was laid off along with the rest of my production team. I am\nconfident that my being laid off had nothing to do with me asking for a raise.\nHowever, in hindsight, I am certain that I looked like a total dolt for even\nasking. Why didn’t I see the writing on the wall? The company just underwent a\ntotal reorganization due to previous bad management. A little patience and\nwillingness to wait for the proverbial dust to settle would have been a better\nplay on my part.\n\nOne time, during the Great Recession, one of our team members came to ask for\na raise. Our company, like many others, had cash flow but only enough to keep\nthings rolling. Raises and bonuses were not going to happen until we recouped\nsome of the nest egg money that we used to keep everyone employed in the first\nplace. This employee tried a few different approaches. First was the pity\nparty: “I’m living on ramen noodles.” Second was the proud party: “I can code\ncircles around everyone in the office.” None of these efforts changed the fact\nthat this programmer surprised us with his request. And by not prepping us, he\nimmediately put himself in an adversarial relationship. He was expecting a\nraise on the spot. We didn’t have raises on the mind or in the budget to react\npositively to the employee’s request. In the end, the employee walked away\nfrustrated and we were left wondering if the employee was going to go look for\nanother job or lose his dedication to our company.\n\nIn fact, when you ask for a raise in this manner it almost always creates an\nawkward situation and a potential contentious relationship with your boss.\nThere is a way, however, to ask for a raise without asking for a raise.\nImagine a conversation like this in a brief closed-door meeting.\n\n**Employee:** “I just wanted to come in and let you know that I love working\nat this company. The team is great. I love the work. I look forward to coming\nin every day.”\n\n**Boss:** “That’s great to hear. You’ve been a great contributor to our\nprojects here.”\n\n**Employee:** “I’m glad to hear you say that; I’m working hard. I wanted to\ntalk with you for a minute and let you know that I view myself being here\nlong-term and I was wondering what steps I should be taking to be able to earn\nfuture raises and promotions. I’m not asking for a raise now; I want to make\nsure I earn it. I just want to get on the same page with you about the types\nof things you are looking for out of me so that when the time comes for\nraises, I’ll deserve one.”\n\n**Boss:** “Great. I appreciate you taking the initiative to ask that. Here are\na few things I’d love to see from you...”\n\n**Employee (takes notes):** “Awesome. I’m going to work on these things. Do\nyou mind if we meet again next month and talk about how I’m progressing with\nyour expectations?”\n\n**Boss:** “That’d be great. I’d love to chat again. Thanks again for bringing\nthis up.”\n\nThis type of conversation accomplishes a few things:\n\nFirst, your boss now knows that you are looking to make more money. But you\ndidn’t ask for money, so they are left with that on their radar. Most bosses\nwill take a minute to consider your current salary and may even look at the\nbudget numbers to see what a raise would look like for you (in preparation for\nthe future conversation).\n\n* * *\n\nASKING FOR A RAISE\n\nIS TRICKY BUSINESS.\n\nTIMING AND TECHNIQUE ARE\n\nCRITICAL TO YOUR SUCCESS\n\nIN RECEIVING A RAISE\n\nWITHOUT DAMAGING\n\nA RELATIONSHIP\n\nIN THE PROCESS.\n\n* * *\n\nSecond, you have paved a way for future salary discussions. This will take the\nawkwardness out of the raise conversation you will have with your boss in the\nnext month. Your boss knows that you will be bringing up salary adjustments in\nthe near future, so there will be no surprises there.\n\nThird, you and your boss are now on the same team working toward your raise\n(instead of a being in a contentious and defensive relationship where your\nboss may feel you are trying to extort more money out of the company budget).\nYou know what the boss is looking for, and your boss is proud that you are\nworking to broaden your contributions to the company.\n\nAsking for a raise is tricky business. Timing and technique are critical to\nyour success in receiving a raise without damaging a relationship in the\nprocess.\n\n\n# Section 5: Mind Your Business\n\nWORKING AS A DESIGNER WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS TRAINING IS LIKE JUMPING FROM AN\nAIRPLANE WITHOUT PARACHUTE TRAINING. SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\n\n## 79\\. Do What You Love; the Money Will Follow\n\nNot unlike many other graphic designers, I was the kid in high school who\ncould draw. I aced all the art classes and thoroughly enjoyed the creative\nprocess. During my first year of college, however, I had yet to decide on a\nmajor. I attended Indiana University, which consistently is one of the top-\nranked business schools in the country. Many of my friends planned to major in\nbusiness. Like an unoriginal sheep I followed along, leaving behind my\nprevious plan of studying commercial art (a.k.a. graphic design). My grades\nand interest in school suffered as I pursued a course of study that I thought\nwould lead to a more financially secure future. I am certain that I spent more\ntime horsing around during my freshman year than I did going to class. But who\ncould blame me? Some of those prebusiness school classes were boring enough to\nmake a snail race seem akin to the Daytona 500.\n\nAfter nearly flunking out my freshman year, my parents were undoubtedly\nconcerned about my future. They could tell that I was not passionate about my\nchoice of study and they encouraged me to reconsider choosing “art” as a\ncareer. My mom brought home a book to help me think things through, titled _Do\nWhat You Love, the Money Will Follow: Discovering Your Right Livelihood_ , by\nMarsha Sinetar. I never read it. I still haven’t. But the genius title was\nenough to change the course of my life. I decided to pursue my degree in\ngraphic design. I honestly thought that one day I would be able to grow into a\ncreative director role and have a maximum salary of $45 to $50K. I figured I\nwould just have to swallow my pride as I watched my business school friends\ngraduate from college with salaries twice that size, and I took solace in the\nknowledge that at least I would be doing something I loved for a living.\n\n![Image](../images/00107.jpeg)\n\nIt did not take long for me to learn that it makes absolutely no difference\nwhat career path you choose—you can make plenty of money in your career if you\nare truly passionate about it. If you really love what you do, you will work\nhard at it. It won’t seem like work. Educating yourself on your chosen\nprofession will be a lifelong commitment. Your passion will drive you to grow\nin your abilities. It is this passion that will drive you toward hard work and\npersistence, and the combination of those things will lead you to success. The\nlove you have for your career will empower you to become the very best at\nwhatever it is you are doing, and chances are that if you are the very best at\nit, someone will likely want to pay you big bucks to do it. I know of some\nvery wealthy scrapbookers, dancers, and musicians who stayed true to\nthemselves and followed their dreams.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about proceeding through life in this manner is\nthat if you really love what you do for a living, the money thing matters so\nmuch less. Who cares how much money you make if you get to go to a job that\npays you to be doing something you would be doing for free? This is how I view\nmy career in graphic design. I love it. I work hard at it. I have been\npersistent. I have been on a never-ending quest of self-education, and—in the\nend—the money did follow. As my skills grew, I garnered new job offers. As I\ncontributed to the success of companies I worked for, I got raises. By the\ntime I was 28 years old, I was a creative director at Fox with a windowed\noffice overlooking Beverly Hills and I was drawing a salary three times the\nsize of what I thought would be my maximum after decades of work. I started my\nown business at age 30, a roller coaster ride that has definitely been filled\nwith more ups than downs, and with notable clients I only dreamed I could\nserve.\n\nIronically, after shunning the pursuit of a degree in business to follow my\nheart and choose a creative career, I now find myself in a businessman’s chair\nin love with my profession. I admit there were times during the transition\nfrom designer to creative director to business owner where I lamented having\nlost the opportunity to manhandle Photoshop day in and day out. I felt like I\nhad promoted myself right out of a career I loved and into a role I had\nstrived to avoid. And then came the epiphany: “I may not create websites and\nlogos anymore. But I still create. Now I am creating a business, a culture, a\nbrand.” This thought has driven me to invest my creative energy into something\nnew. And the love I once had for design has been fully transferred to a love\nfor creating a business. And, as the phrase goes, the money has followed me\nthere, too.\n\nI certainly can’t promise the same results to everyone reading this. I realize\nthat I have been very fortunate in my circumstances. Choosing a career path\nthat I love has made all the difference in my life. Money could never replace\nthe joy of making a living doing something that seems like the hobby you\nalways dreamed of doing.\n\n* * *\n\nMONEY COULD NEVER REPLACE\n\nTHE JOY OF MAKING\n\nA LIVING DOING SOMETHING\n\nTHAT SEEMS LIKE THE HOBBY\n\nYOU ALWAYS DREAMED\n\nOF DOING.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 80\\. A Business That Looks Orderly\n\n_“A business that looks orderly says to your customer that your people know\nwhat they’re doing. A business that looks orderly says to your people that you\nknow what you’re doing. A business that looks orderly says that while the\nworld may not work, some things can. A business that looks orderly says to\nyour customer that he can trust in the result delivered and assures your\npeople that they can trust in their future with you. A business that looks\norderly says that the structure is in place.”_\n\n—The E-Myth Revisited, _1995, 103_\n\nThe _E-Myth Revisited_ is one of the few paradigm-shift business books out\nthere, as there are more than a few phrases in the book that have the capacity\nto be life-changing, some of which have had a huge impact on my career.\n\nI had just hired my first few employees and I was making adjustments to how\nthey operated versus how I operated. One employee liked doing things one way,\nwhile I liked doing them another. After reading a part of _The E-Myth\nRevisited_ that spoke of the merits of an orderly business and its impression\non potential clients, I realized that what I had was not an orderly\nbusiness—it was a room full of freelancers, and our clients could sense it. I\nstarted right then to try to present a unified message to our clients, with\nthe goal being a consistent, methodical way of operating our company.\n\nI created a little internal website that documented our “orderly standards.”\nIt included everything from how to answer the phone to how to deliver a\nproject. The internal site became “the law” for everyone to follow. As a\nresult, our clients from that day on have had a consistent experience with our\ncompany. Whether working directly with me or with the person we hired last\nweek, their experience will be the same.\n\nTHE E-MYTH REVISITED by MICHAEL E. GERBER. Copyright (c) 1995, 2001 by Michael\nE.

This will allow them to have confidence in you no matter what. It\nwill also give you confidence in yourself; if you repeatedly carry out your\nday-to-day business in a way that is precise and orderly, you will soon find\nthat you can take comfort in those consistencies, even on the days when your\nlife and your work feel like a stormy sea at best.\n\n![Image](../images/00108.jpeg)\n\n\n## 81\\. Making Cents of It All\n\nWith over 1,500 projects under my belt as a freelancer and business owner,\nsaying that I’ve experimented with pricing structures may be the\nunderstatement of the year. In my early years, nearly everything was based on\na fixed bid. As my client list grew, I began landing some hourly gigs,\nretainers, and some dedicated resource structures. Each of these pricing\nstructures has pros and cons, for you as a designer as well as for your\nclient. Understanding these pricing structures, explaining them clearly to\nyour clients, and choosing the right one for the job can make the difference\nbetween a blissful client experience and your worst nightmare.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00109.jpeg) **Fixed Bid**\n\nFixed-bid pricing is a set scope of work with a fixed price. You tell the\nclient exactly what you are going to do and exactly what it is going to cost.\nAs long as the client stays within the scope of the project, they are charged\nthe price you quoted. In my experience, fixed-bid pricing is the option most\ncommonly used in the graphic design industry.\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nYou know exactly what you are going to make on the project. If the job takes\nyou less time than you expected, you make more profit.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\nSince you are locked into a price, if the job takes you more time than\nexpected, you make less profit (you could even lose money).\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nThe client knows exactly what they are going to have to pay, assuming they\nstay within the project scope. They can reasonably assume that they will be\nable to stay within their allocated budget for the project.\n\n**_Cons for the client:_**\n\nDue to the tricky nature of fixed-bid pricing, you as the design agency will\noften need to pad your estimate to account for any unforeseen challenges in\nthe project. As a result, the client could end up paying a lot more for a\nproject than if it were priced in a different structure. Additionally, if the\nclient goes out of the scope to a degree that requires you to send them change\norders, they can become frustrated and feel like you are nickel-and-diming\nthem.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nWith fixed-bid pricing, you must clearly define the scope of the project. If\nyou don’t have every little detail (deliverables, functionality, design\nrounds, change rounds, and so on) defined in your proposal, there is a high\nlikelihood that you will eventually get stung by a fixed-bid project.\n\nYou must try to help the client adhere to the defined project scope.\nUnfortunately, no matter what you do to clearly detail the project, there is a\nchance that the client will come up with something they want you to do that\nwas not included in your scope. Keeping them “in scope” can be a challenging\nclient management task.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nFixed-bid structures are best used when the client knows exactly what they\nwant you to produce and exactly what they are comfortable spending.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00110.jpeg) **Hourly**\n\nYou and your client agree on an hourly rate. You track your hours and bill\nyour client in regularly agreed-upon intervals (such as weekly or monthly).\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nFor every hour you spend on a project, you have something to bill for. This\nstructure eliminates the risk of losing money on a project.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\n“Value pricing” doesn’t come into play here. If you design a logo in one hour,\nyou are locked into charging your client the agreed-upon hourly rate even\nthough the “value” of the logo to the client far exceeded what they paid for\nit.\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nThe client does not need a clearly defined project scope to begin working with\nyou. They have the flexibility to change their mind on things and add new\nitems to your plate.\n\n**_Cons for the client:_**\n\nIt can be difficult for the client to know how much they should budget for\nyour services if they pay by the hour.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nTo help keep your client relationship healthy, it is recommended that you\nregularly communicate how many hours you are spending for the client’s\nprojects. Also, for each request they make, tell them roughly how many hours\nit will take. Nobody likes to be surprised by a giant bill.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nHourly structures are best used in maintenance situations. Perhaps you have\nfinished a website project and the client would like you to make occasional\nsite updates. Or, you did a stationery package and the client would like you\nto create business cards for a new employee.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00111.jpeg) **Retainer**\n\nRetainers are also based on hours spent on a project. Typically, you give the\nclient a discounted rate for guaranteeing you hours (usually by month). For\nexample, if your standard rate is $100 per hour and you are pitching your\nclient a retainer structure, you could discount the rate based on the number\nof hours they retain. (If the client retains 20 to 40 hours per month they pay\n$90 per hour, 41 to 60 hours per month they pay $80 per hour, 61 to 80 hours\nper month they pay $70 per hour, and so on.) Retainers are purchasing a bucket\nof hours to be used for the client’s requests. Those hours are usually spread\nacross whatever team members are necessary to complete the request.\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nYou get guaranteed monthly billings. This can give you cash flow and the\nconfidence to allow you to hire new employees or expand your business in other\nways against the retainer.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\nBy reducing your rate based on hours retained, you are also reducing your\nprofit margin. Also, as with the previously mentioned hourly pricing\nstructure, “value pricing” does not apply.\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nBy paying a reduced rate for guaranteed hours, the client gets more work for\nless money.\n\n**_Cons client:_**\n\nIn this pricing structure, the client has a responsibility to fill the\nretained hours or they lose them. If they retain 40 hours per month and use\nonly 38 hours, they still pay for the 40 hours.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nSince the client is retaining hours, you must be extremely attentive to their\nneeds until the hours are used up. It is also important to keep an accurate\naccounting of the hours for proper billing.\n\nOftentimes, a client will have a challenge understanding that they are\npurchasing a block of hours from you, and that whether they use them or not,\nyou have made arrangements in your business to have those hours available for\nthem. If the client uses more hours than the agreed-upon retainer, they should\npay for the extra hours. We typically charge their retained rate plus 10\npercent for all extra hours beyond the retainer. (For example, if the client\nis retaining 80 hours per month and they use 90 hours, they pay $70 per hour\nfor the first 80 hours and then $77 per hour for the extra 10 hours.) The\nreason for the increased cost attached to extra hours is to accommodate for\nthe unanticipated and unscheduled workload.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nRetainers work best when the client knows that they have an ample amount of\nprojects that they will need you to complete over a set amount of time but\nthey are still unclear of the details.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00112.jpeg) **Dedicated Resources**\n\nSlightly different from retainers, the dedicated resource structure allocates\ncertain employees to a client for a certain period of time. Retainer\nstructures buy hours. Dedicated resource structures buy people. This structure\nis usually calculated in “man weeks.” You work with the client to determine\nhow long you expect the project to take and dedicate specific employees to the\ntask. The more “man weeks” the client buys, the lower the rate they pay. (For\nexample, if the agreement dedicates an employee for 4 to 6 “man weeks” they\npay $5,000 per week, for 7 to 10 weeks they pay $4,500 per week, for 11 to 14\nweeks they pay $4,000 per week, and so on.)\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nLike retainers, this structure can give you the cash flow and confidence to\nexpand your business.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\nAlso like retainers, you are charging a reduced rate, which reduces your\nprofit margin. You also may need to dedicate some of your top performers to a\nclient, thus losing their involvement on other projects.\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nThe client pays less money for more work and can build a strong working\nrelationship with your team members as they collaborate closely on the\nproject.\n\n**_Cons for the client:_**\n\nFor the set term of the agreement, essentially it is as if the client is\nemploying your team members directly.

How to Calculate a Burn Rate\n\nHow can you know how much to charge if you don’t know how much you cost? I\nspent a lot of years pulling prices out of thin air. I had no idea what I\nshould be charging, and to be honest, I was willing to work for whatever\nsomeone would pay. As my company began to grow, I quickly learned the\nimportance of understanding costs. Knowing your costs can help you massage\nyour pricing and land new clients. It can also help you know how much time to\nallocate to each project.\n\nI certainly don’t claim to be an accountant, and my accountant may read this\nand think I’m off my rocker. But here’s a simple formula to use to calculate\nyour hourly burn rate (that is, what your graphic design business costs you\nper hour):\n\n_Annual Overhead Cost ÷ Annual Production Hours_\n\n_= Hourly Burn Rate_\n\nHere are a couple of scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n\nYou are a freelancer working out of your basement. You decide that you should\nbe earning $60,000 per year for your salary. Your utilities (Internet\nconnection, electricity, cell phone, etc.) cost you roughly $300 per month (or\n$3,600 per year). Your equipment (computer, printer, software upgrades, etc.)\ncosts approximately $5,000 per year. Your business expenses (industry and\nbusiness group annual fees, car mileage, paper, business licenses, etc.) cost\nabout $2,000 per year. Don’t forget to factor in vendor expenses (accountant\nfees and so on) at a typical rate of $1,500 per year.\n\n_$60,000 + $3,600 + $5,000 + $2,000 + $1,500_\n\n_= $72,100 Total Annual Overhead_\n\nThe average number of work hours in a calendar year for a full-time employee\nranges from 2,080 to 2,096, depending on holidays and specific business\npractices. We use 2,080 hours as our number. Now, assuming you are self-\nemployed, don’t forget that it takes administrative time to run your business\n(you can’t bill a client directly for balancing your checkbook or attending an\nAIGA meeting). Let’s say you spend 10 percent of your time doing\n“nonproduction” tasks to keep your business running. That leaves you with\n1,872 production hours per year that you can bill for if the project pipeline\nis full. Now you have your numbers. Run them through the formula to figure out\nwhat you must charge per hour to “break even.”\n\n_$72,100 ÷ 1,872 = $38.51_\n\nYour hourly burn rate is $38.51. Now you can safely set a rate for your\nclients and understand where your wiggle room is. But you cannot go below\n$38.51 per hour without losing money (or paying yourself less than your\ndesired salary of $60,000). You also can make a judgment call on what you want\nto spend your time doing. I got really crazy at one point and started\nthinking, “If it takes me three hours to mow my lawn, that will cost me\n$115.53! I’m better off hiring the neighbor kid to do it for $30...that’s\n$85.53 back in my pocket!”\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\nYou are a small business with, let’s say, five employees (including yourself).\nYour salary is $70,000 per year, your three designers each make $40,000, and\nyour receptionist makes $20,000 per year (totaling $210,000 in salary costs).\nYou are leasing an office that costs $2,000 per month ($24,000 per year). Your\nremaining expenses cost roughly $40,000 per year.\n\n_$210,000 + $24,000 + $40,000_\n\n_= $274,000 Total Annual Overhead_\n\nYour receptionist’s time can’t be billed directly to a client, so that person\ndoesn’t account for production hours. Each of your designers is fully\ndedicated to production, so they each account for 2,080 (6,240 production\nhours). However, you spend only 20 percent of your time doing billable\nproduction work (the rest is spent doing administrative tasks and sales). That\ngives you only 416 production hours per year (20% of 2,080). Your total\nproduction hour number is 6,656 (6,240 + 416). Input them into the formula.\n\n_$274,000 ÷ 6,656 = $41.17_\n\nYour hourly burn rate is $41.17. What will really drive you nuts is\ncalculating what idle employee time costs you. When your three designers get\ncarried away playing Call of Duty for an hour in the afternoon, it could cost\nyou upwards of $123.51!\n\n**How to be profitable:**\n\nNow that you have a burn rate, the profitability calculation is easy. Simply\ntack on a profitability percentage to the hourly burn rate and you will have\nan hourly rate to charge your clients. If your burn rate is $38.51 and you\nfeel a 20 percent profit margin is fair, then you should charge your customer\n$46.21 per hour.\n\n_$38.51 + $7.702 (20% of $38.51) = $46.21_\n\nIf your hourly burn rate is $41.17 and you are comfortable with a 50 percent\nprofit margin, then charge your customer $61.76 per hour.\n\n_$41.17 + $20.585 (20% of $41.17) = $61.76_\n\nThis isn’t a perfect science and your accountant will likely be able to help\nyou find a much more accurate number. But this simple formula helps us\nimmensely in our bidding process, and hopefully it will help you in your\nfreelance and other business affairs.\n\n![Image](../images/00113.jpeg)\n\n\n## 83\\. The Fixed-Bid Pricing Dartboard\n\nTrying to figure out how to price your work fairly can be a daunting task. In\nmy experience, most clients prefer working with fixed-bid pricing; they take\ncomfort in knowing exactly what they are going to get for exactly what price.\nOn the designer side, there is comfort in knowing exactly what you are going\nto charge for the scope of work. Fixed-bid pricing presents several\nchallenges, not the least of which is the fact that you have to base your\nprice on something. When I first started freelancing, that “something” was\noften hours. I decided to charge around $60 per hour for my time, and then I\nwould ballpark my hours and send an estimate to my client. The problem with\nthis was that I am a very fast designer and production artist. So by charging\nbased on hours, I was charging too little for most of the work I was\nproducing. That left me in a situation where I either needed to up my hourly\nrate or figure out a new way to price things.\n\n![Image](../images/00114.jpeg)\n\nI began trying to price things based on the deliverables. My estimates would\ninclude itemized pricing for each of the elements being produced. Take a\nwebsite for example. I would charge $500 for a home page and $150 for each\nsubpage. Then I’d add up all the pages and come up with a price. It didn’t\ntake me too long to learn (the hard way) that this strategy was riddled with\nproblems (see the chapter “[Beware of Line-Item\nPricing](part0095.html#ch084),” in this section, for more details).\n\nAfter experimenting with other strategies, I realized that there is no perfect\nscience to estimating your work. It frequently seems as if you are throwing a\ndart at a board and seeing where it lands. In some ways this is true. With\nfixed-bid pricing, you are often throwing out a dart and hoping you land on\nthe board in a quadrant that will generate a profit. While there is no perfect\nmethod to estimating your work, there is a strategy to making sure you are\nthrowing your dart toward the right area of the board.\n\n![Image](../images/00115.jpeg)\n\nFixed-bid pricing is a careful balance between three components: cost, value,\nand budget. Let’s examine each one.\n\n**Cost:** The first component that must be considered when estimating your\nwork is cost. You must know what your time to create the project will cost.\nThis can be done by either determining a fair hourly rate and adding up the\nnumber of hours you expect the project to take, or by figuring out your exact\nhourly cost (divide your annual overhead by your quantity of production hours\navailable in the year) and then adding a profit margin percentage on top.\n\n**Value:** The second element for consideration is the fair market value of\nthe project. Just because you can nail a logo design in one hour doesn’t mean\nyou should charge the client only $60. There is a value to the logo that far\noutweighs $60. Every designer should have the book _Graphic Artists Guild\nHandbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines_, by the Graphic Artists Guild. A new\nissue of the book comes out every few years, and it contains categorized\npricing for each type of graphic design service based on survey averages from\ndesign professionals nationwide. This is a great place to get an idea of what\nfair market value is for design work. Please keep in mind when reviewing the\nsurvey averages that the size and expertise of the design professionals is not\nreflected in the pricing. If the survey says a brochure for a medium-size\nbusiness should cost $8,000 and you are a wet-behind-the-ears college\ngraduate, don’t expect to be able to green light a brochure at that price. The\nobjective is to gain a sense of what other people, similar to you, charge for\nthe same types of projects you are trying to land.\n\n**Budget:** Finally, you must have a sense of what the client’s budget is for\nthe project. If you wrongly assume the budget is high, then you may send an\nestimate that prices you out of getting the project (when you would have been\nhappy charging less and landing the work). If you wrongly assume the budget is\nlow, then you may undercharge for the work and not be able to turn a profit on\nthe project. (For help with figuring out a client’s budget, see the chapter\n“[How to Flush Out a Budget](part0097.html#ch086),” in this section of the\nbook.)\n\n![Image](../images/00116.jpeg)\n\nNow you that have these three components for consideration, it is time for the\nbalancing act. Let’s throw a few darts at the board.\n\n**A client wants you to complete “Project X.”**\n\nYou expect the project will take you 10 hours at your hourly rate of $60 =\n$600.\n\nYou determine that the project has a fair market value of $2,000 based on\nindustry averages.\n\nAnd you know that the client has a budget of $1,000 to complete the work.\n\nA simple approach would be to average these three elements and send your\nclient the estimate ($600 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $3,600 ÷ 3 = $1,200).\n\nUnfortunately it is not always as simple as just averaging out the numbers\nbased on the variables. There are times when you must skew toward one of the\nthree components.\n\n**A client wants you to complete “Project Y.”**\n\nYou expect the project will take you 100 hours at your hourly rate of $60 =\n$6,000.\n\nYou determine that the project has a fair market value of $15,000 based on\nindustry averages.\n\nAnd you know that the client has a budget of $7,000 to complete the work.\n\nIn this case, if you want to land the work, you must steer your estimate\ntoward the client’s budget. My recommendation would be to balance it somewhere\nin between your hourly cost and the client’s budget, say $6,750 or so. You are\nstill way below fair market value but still in a zone where you can turn a\nprofit on the project.\n\n**A client wants you to complete “Project Z.”**\n\nYou expect the project will take you 200 hours at your hourly rate of $60 =\n$12,000.\n\nYou determine that the project has a fair market value of $18,000 based on\nindustry averages.\n\nAnd you know that the client has a budget of $25,000 to complete the work.\n\nIn this case you could estimate the project in the $18,000 range. Then,\ndepending on your relationship comfort level, you could let the client know\nthat you did some market research and found that this type of project is\ncosting less than what they had budgeted, and you didn’t feel it would be fair\nto charge them their full budgeted amount. This type of thing usually goes\nover very well and could be a great way to start off a project.\n\n![Image](../images/00117.jpeg)\n\nIn the end, there certainly seems to be a dartboard involved in fixed-bid\npricing. Use your best judgment on which component you should skew your price\ntoward. The better you understand the project, your client, and their\nexpectations, the easier this will be.\n\n\n## 84\\. Beware of Line-Item Pricing\n\nMost clients will be drawn to fixed-bid pricing. They want to know exactly\nwhat the project is going to cost and they expect you to stay on budget. From\nthe designer’s side, fixed-bid pricing isn’t altogether bad, since you will\nknow exactly how much you are going to make on the project.\n\nWhen I first started freelancing, I worked exclusively via fixed-bid pricing\nscales. A client would send me the specs for a project, and I would attach\npricing to the project and gain the client’s approval for that amount. I would\nbe meticulous in this, breaking down each item the project would entail in\nminute detail.\n\nFirst, I would figure out how long the whole job would take, and then I would\nbreak it out into itemized pricing. For example, if a client wants a logo\ndesign along with a stationery package, I would estimate that I would need\nabout two days of production to complete the whole project. So let’s say that\nI attach a cost of $2,000 to the project. Then, in order to help the client\nget an idea of where the costs lie, I would spread out the $2,000 across all\nthe elements of the project.\n\n**Option A**\n\nLogo Design = $800\n\nBusiness Card Design = $400\n\nLetterhead Design = $400\n\nEnvelope Design = $400\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\nEach of these items would be explained in the proposal so the client knew\nexactly what they were getting for each element. I felt cool. This line-item\npricing looked legit and organized. Look at me! I’m a graphic designer sending\nout fancy bids.\n\nWARNING: BEWARE OF ESTIMATING THINGS THIS WAY!\n\nI’ve been burned more times than I’d like to admit by this pricing strategy.\nThe client will look at this breakdown and decide that they can live without\nthe letterhead and envelopes and then ask to pull those elements from the\nproject, leaving me with $1,200 to do a job that is probably still worth\ncloser to the $2,000 mark than the $1,200 I will now be making.\n\nThe realities of this project is that most of the design work is done in the\n“Logo Design” phase. You put the brain power into this part, and as you are\ndesigning the logos you are making mental considerations for how the designs\nwill convert into the other stationery elements. Also, once you design the\nbusiness cards, the letterhead and envelope will be a piece of cake. The truth\nof the matter is that the cost breakdown for this project would be something\ncloser to this.\n\n**Option B**\n\nLogo Design = $1,600\n\nBusiness Card Design = $200\n\nLetterhead Design = $100\n\nEnvelope Design = $100\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\nHowever, with this line-item pricing the client will look at it and possibly\nbalk at the $1,600 logo price. Most small businesses would rather have their\ncousin’s friend’s brother design their logo on trade for a new pair of\nsneakers than pay $1,600 for their logo design. So, you shouldn’t send line-\nitem pricing this way, either.\n\nIn the end, sending the client one lump-sum price like Option C is better than\nthe previous options, but this isn’t a great solution either, since breaking\nout the costs helps the client swallow a big bill easier (kind of like when\nyou go to get your car fixed at an auto repair shop).\n\n**Option C**\n\nLogo, Business Card, Letterhead, and Envelope Design = $2,000\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\n![Image](../images/00118.jpeg)\n\nSo what is a designer to do? You will need to break out pricing more in line\nwith the realities of the project. Detail out exactly what the client is going\nto get (deliverables) and then break down the pricing in this fashion.\n\n**Option D**\n\nProject Management = $300\n\nDesign = $1,000\n\nProduction = $700\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\n“Project Management” includes deliveries, phone calls, and administrative\nelements required to execute on the project. “Design” covers the creative\ntasks required to succeed on the project. And “Production” is for creation of\npress-ready files. With this strategy, the pricing is itemized so that the\nclient can understand how you arrived at the total price. But none of the\nitemized elements can be removed from the project (as they could in Option A)\nwithout requiring you to send a revised estimate to the client.\n\nThere will be times when a client will force you to break down a project as in\nOption A; they want to know exactly what each item will cost. If you must do\nso to win the job, then you must. Be careful when breaking down the price, and\nask yourself these critical questions when you look at your numbers: “If the\nclient pulls out any one item of this cost breakdown, will I still be happy\nwith the total price of the job? If they pull an item, will I still be able to\nexecute on the other elements at the individual prices they are quoted?” If\nyou answer no to either question, then rework the numbers until you are\nsatisfied. When a client forces you into itemizing a project, then you have to\nassume that they are considering pulling out elements. Brace yourself and\ntread lightly.\n\nIf you are forced into an Option A type of estimate and are satisfied with\nyour itemized prices, be sure to cover yourself by mentioning that your\npricing takes into consideration economies of scale. For more information\nabout that, please refer to the chapter “[Twenty-Piece Chicken\nMcNuggets](part0098.html#ch087),” in this section of the book.\n\n\n## 85\\. “No Charge” Doesn’t Mean “Free”\n\nAt the end of 2009, my company green lit our biggest single-dollar project\never. Eight long months later, we were dealing with the biggest project\ndisaster in our company’s history. We worked with the client through changing\nscope and shifting ideas, rolling with the punches all along. After receiving\nthe green light, we submitted changes and restarted the project three times.\nEach of these times required us to rewrite the proposal, and resulted in us\nmaking the decision to eat the work we had completed on previously green-lit\nelements that were no longer part of the client’s strategy moving forward.\n\nFinally, the client requested the fourth change in scope, this time attempting\nto cut the project in half based on a new investor who was planning to\ncomplete some of the elements themselves. In a heated and uncomfortable phone\ncall with the client, we told them that their newly-proposed budget for\nproposal #4, which was 50 percent of the original budget, did not leave us\nroom to absorb the cost related to items previously green lit in proposals #1,\n#2, and #3 that were now cancelled. The client said, “We don’t see any listing\nof the costs of those items in proposals #2 or #3.” They were right. We had\ndecided to eat those changes for the good of the relationship with the client,\nbut we never documented it to make them aware. We were doing a good deed for\nour relationship and they had no idea we were doing them any favors; we were\nreceiving absolutely nothing for our generosity.\n\nMost of us have heard the phrase, “Nothing in life is free.” I did a little\nresearch and couldn’t find the origin of this phrase, but I spent a great deal\nof time pondering its meaning. In graphic design, you may do a lot of work for\n“no charge,” but that does not mean it is “free.” You give away your time and\nenergy at “no charge” in hopeful expectation of some reward from your client,\nsuch as an improved relationship, future favors, referrals, and additional\nprojects, to name just a few.\n\nIn order to make sure your client is aware of your generous gifts of time, you\nmust document all of the work you complete for the client whether you charge\nthem for it or not. This strategy can be accomplished easily in your proposals\nand invoices. Perhaps an example will help illustrate this point.\n\nA client comes to you requesting a logo design. You send a simple proposal to\ncreate a logo for them at a price of $500. During the design process, you\ndecide to create a business card design to show off how cool the logo is to\nthe client. The client is awed by your killer design skills and asks you to\ncomplete press-ready files for the business cards. Since the design is already\ncomplete, you decide to throw it in for “free.” In order to make sure your\nclient is aware of your generosity, you could add a line to your invoice like\nthis:\n\nLogo Design = $500\n\nBusiness Card Design ($300 value) = No Charge\n\nTotal Amount Due = $500\n\nIf you hadn’t highlighted this to your client, you would be less likely to be\ncompensated in nonfinancial ways for your good will.\n\nWe recently had a client re-sign a retainer agreement with us. Their three-\nmonth-long retainer bought 80 hours per month of design and production at a\nprice of $8,000 per month. However, due to budget constraints heading into\ntheir year-end, they asked to reduce the retainer hours by 10 percent. As a\ngesture of kindness toward the client, we decided to keep their monthly hours\nthe same and just discount our rate. They were grateful for our generosity.\nBut we failed to document our generosity when we sent them the new proposal.\n\n![Image](../images/00119.jpeg)\n\nOur proposal stated:\n\n80 hours per month of design and production = $7,200\n\nHowever, we should have written our proposal like this:\n\n80 hours per month of design and production = $8,000\n\n10% discount = -$800\n\nTotal Monthly Rate = $7,200\n\nWhen this client’s retainer expired a few months later, their expectation was\nto re-sign at $7,200 per month for 80 hours of work, having long forgotten\nthat they were receiving a discounted rate. For us to reinstate our original\nprice of $8,000 for the same quantity of work, it would appear as if we are\nupping our prices, and our generosity will essentially have done nothing more\nthan backfire on us.\n\nIn addition to throwing in free design elements now and then, you might\nconsider offering discounts like these:\n\n**Friends and Family Discount:** Can be offered to some of your close friends\nand relatives.\n\n**Repeat Customer Discount:** Perhaps you offer a discounted rate for a return\ncustomer.\n\n**Education Discounts:** Provided for educational institutions.\n\n**Charitable Organization Discount:** For charitable organizations, we work\nfor “non-profit” by charging our cost to the client. In other words, we charge\nthem our overhead cost to do work for them, rather than charging them a rate\nthat leaves us profit in the end.\n\nNo matter what your system or verbiage turns out to be, the important thing is\nthat you be sure to create proposals and invoices that document your full rate\nand then reflect the discount in a separate line item.\n\n\n## 86\\. How to Flush Out a Budget\n\nProposals can take a lot of time to create, and if you don’t land the project\nyou will never be reimbursed for that time and effort. Asking a client for a\nbudget is sometimes risky; they may think that if they tell you their budget,\nyou will just charge them that price whether the project should cost that much\nor not. (And in some cases they may be right.)\n\nThe problem is that if you don’t have a price range from the client, you are\nbidding blind. You don’t know if they want to buy a gourmet meal or a fast-\nfood hamburger. Many people don’t have any idea of the time and cost of\ngraphic design. They may be thinking that the website they want to create will\ncost around $1,000 when in reality their request will cost $10,000.\n\nHere are a few techniques to help you flush out a budget before you go to the\ncostly lengths of creating a full-blown, formal proposal.\n\n**The Direct Approach**\n\n“OK, John, I think I have all of the specifications for the project. Is there\na budget number you are shooting for?”\n\n**Chuck a Range**\n\n“Similar past projects that we have done have cost between $5,000 and $10,000.\nWhere does your budget fit in that price range?”\n\n**Compare Another Product**\n\n“We always like to ask about our client’s budget to know what features we\nshould pack into the proposal. A Hyundai and a Ferrari will both get you from\npoint A to point B. Are you wanting something really high-end for your\nproject? Or are you shopping for a base model to get things rolling, with the\nplan to add features later?”\n\n![Image](../images/00120.jpeg)\n\n**Give a Past Project Example**\n\n“I’m not sure where we’ll end up price-wise in the proposal because I need to\ntalk to my design team to find out how long they think things will take. But I\ncan tell you that our last project like this came to around $5,000. Is that a\nrough price range you would be comfortable with?”\n\n**Project Quick Sheet**\n\nIf you are concerned that the client doesn’t have sufficient budget to do the\nproject, try sending them a Project Quick Sheet before you create a big\nmultipage formal proposal. The Project Quick Sheet is a simple one-page\nestimate that includes:\n\n**_Project Summary_** (a few sentences describing the project)\n\n**_Timeline Estimate_** (approximately how long it will take to complete the\nproject)\n\n**_Cost Estimate_** (estimated pricing for the project)\n\nWhen you send this to the client, you should include a line like this in your\nemail:\n\n_“Before detailing the full scope of the project, we wanted to send you a\nrough estimate to make sure we’re on the same page. The attached Project Quick\nSheet provides a project summary, timeline, and cost for the project as we\nunderstand it. Please let us know if these three items seem in line with your\nthoughts and we’ll get to work on the full-blown proposal that details out the\nentire project. Thanks!”_\n\nThese techniques do a great job of either scaring away a client who has no\nbudget or bolstering your confidence in the bid process by knowing your\nclient’s budget range.\n\n\n## 87\\. Twenty-Piece Chicken McNuggets\n\nI’ll be the first to admit, I got a D in Economics 101 during my freshman year\nof college. But I assure you it was not because I don’t understand economics.\nIt was simply because I was spending way more time goofing around than I spent\ngoing to class. In order to earn my D, I really learned only two things. The\nfirst was “The Law of Diminishing Returns” (in layman’s terms, you are more\nproductive during hour one of the work day compared to hour 20, or the first\npiece of cheesecake is more satisfying than the 10th piece of cheesecake when\neaten in one sitting). The second thing I learned was “Economies of Scale.”\nLet’s take a minute to discuss the second.\n\nEconomies of scale basically means that unit costs of a product or service go\ndown as volume goes up, as in mass production (that is, the bigger the\nproject, the lower the associated cost per unit).\n\nHere are a few examples of how economies of scale play out in the graphic\ndesign industry.\n\nA client approaches you to design a website for their business. You conduct an\nanalysis of their needs and expect the site to be 10 pages. You determine that\nthe price for their 10-page website will be $10,000, accounting for 100 hours\nof work.\n\nAnother client approaches you to design their website, and after a needs\nanalysis you find that their site will require 15 pages (50 percent larger\nthan the 10-page site). After you crunch the numbers with your team, you find\nthat the 15-page site will really take only 10 hours longer than the 10-page\nsite, so you send an estimate for $11,000 (only 10 percent more than the\n10-page site).\n\nThis is economies of scale in action. Each site requires initial design work\nto create the overall look and feel. By the time three to five pages are fully\nprogrammed, the programmers have enough code to reuse, thus allowing the\nadditional five pages to take very little time to complete. In fact, the\ninitial design and programming is so labor intensive that a 3- to 5-page\nwebsite may cost only slightly less than a 10-page website (depending on the\ncomplexity of the design).\n\nAs another example of economies of scale, maybe you are designing a series of\nmagazine ads. To create the initial concept for the first ad, it may require\n80 percent of the creative brain power and design time for the whole project.\nThus the additional ads in the series require only a fraction of the time\nnecessary to create the original ad.\n\nAs a further example on press, the per-unit print pricing goes down when the\nvolume goes up. For example, a 10,000-piece press run may cost $1.00 per unit\n($10,000), and a 1,000-piece press run may cost $10.00 per unit ($10,000).\nThis is due to the labor and set-up time that goes into each project, large or\nsmall, as well as the cost of materials going down with volume increase.\n\nEven fast food chains offer economies of scale! When you buy a combo meal,\nyour drink and fries price-per-unit goes down due to discounts based on\nvolume. My favorite example of economies of scale is found in Chicken\nMcNuggets. While a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets costs $3.99 (or 39¢ per Nugget),\nthe 20-piece version is just $4.99. That comes out to only 25¢ per Nugget!\nEconomies of scale can be found everywhere.\n\nMy company once had a squirrelly client who kept trying to cut the price on\ntheir project. (Actually, we’ve had many squirrelly clients for that matter.)\nWe sent our original proposal to the client and they requested that we break\nout all our pricing into line items. We accommodated their request, after\nwhich they began cutting items off of the list based on their line-item price.\nIn the end, the scope of work was cut down to fit their budget and we were\nleft with several minimally profitable pieces. After we developed the initial\nelements they began to cut down the project again. What started as a $200,000\nbudget was cut to $100,000 and then cut to $50,000. We tried to explain to\nthem “economies of scale,” and that the per-unit price found in a $200,000\nbudget is less than the per-unit price found in a $50,000 budget. They scoured\nour proposal and said, “Your proposal says nothing about this. It merely shows\nthe line-item prices and we expect you to stick to your proposal.” We were\nleft with nothing to say.\n\nTo avoid having this ever happen again, we’ve added a simple line to our\nproposal.\n\n_“This estimate represents a ‘package price’ based on economies of scale. If\nelements are added to or removed from the scope of work, a new proposal will\nbe required, as the pricing for other elements could be affected.”_\n\nThis line in your proposal opens up your ability to explain to your client the\nconcept of economies of scale, and empowers you to renegotiate pricing when\nyour client makes attempts to cut items from the scope of the project.\n\n![Image](../images/00121.jpeg)\n\n\n## 88\\. Nonprofits for Non-Profit\n\nThere is no shortage of people in the world who think you should do graphic\ndesign work for free. After all, it is only time that is being spent to design\nthings, and you are having fun while you do it. It doesn’t really “cost”\nanything, right?\n\nMost designers have pro bono work going on nearly all the time. There is\nalways their brother’s logo or their uncle’s website under heavy construction.\nEach of those pro bono jobs seems to lead to referrals for more pro bono jobs.\nI certainly have done my share of free design work, and my company seems to\nhave a steady stream of charitable organizations requesting our services.\n\nMany charitable organizations run on very tight budgets. Typically the head of\nthese organizations is a master at asking for favors and receiving them. Be\naware that one favor usually leads to two. Two favors usually leads to three.\nAnd before you know it, you are swallowed up doing a ton of free work to\nsupport their organization. Most of these charitable organizations provide\nadmirable services and are worth the consideration of your generous support.\nHowever, you have a right to provide those services under your terms. Here are\na few ways to consider working with charities.\n\n**Service**\n\nIf you believe in the organization and have the time, providing free graphic\ndesign services may be right up your alley. Go for it!\n\n**Portfolio Boost**\n\nIt may be worth your time to provide graphic design services for free if the\nproject will be a great enhancement to your portfolio. Sometimes free design\nwork empowers you to be more creative and more easily control the flow of the\nproject.\n\n**One at a Time**\n\nI’ve heard of agencies that limit their charitable client list to a maximum of\none or two. This empowers you to easily say “no” when you are being cornered\nby another charitable organization.\n\n**Set Scope of Work**\n\nWith any project, paid or unpaid, it is critical to clearly define the scope\nof work. However, with charity work this becomes even more important. You\nshould still create a proposal whether the project has payment or not. In the\nproposal you must clearly define what work you will be doing for free and what\nwork will require payment. For example, if you agree to design and build a\ncharity’s website for free but want to keep from being abused in the future,\nbe sure to clarify that all changes requested after launch of the site will be\nbilled at $X per hour. You don’t have to do everything for free.\n\n**Nonprofits for Non-Profit**\n\nOne of my agency’s most valued clients is a nonprofit organization that is\noperated by a multibillionaire. They have been our client for many years and\nwe charge them our cost. We support their nonprofit efforts by providing\ngraphic design services at no profit to us. We have created and maintained\nseveral websites and branding initiatives for them, and we bill them by the\nhour on a monthly basis.\n\n**Nonprofit for Profit**\n\nJust because a company is a nonprofit does not mean they have no money. Some\nof the larger charities actually have giant marketing budgets. Don’t be afraid\nto treat a nonprofit like any other client. Just because their business is\nnon-profit doesn’t mean that your business has to be.\n\nI strongly encourage providing charitable design services. Charitable giving\nis part of our society, and service is at the heart of the graphic design\nprofession. Just make sure you stay seated in the captain’s chair if you are\ndoing the work for free.\n\n* * *\n\nTHERE IS NO SHORTAGE\n\nOF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD\n\nWHO THINK YOU SHOULD\n\nDO GRAPHIC DESIGN\n\nWORK FOR FREE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 89\\. The Code of Fair Practice\n\nI worked for nearly ten years as a professional graphic designer prior to\nfinding out about the Code of Fair Practice. Maybe you already know about it\nand I’m the crazy one, but just in case, here is the ever-important\ninformation that you must understand.\n\nThe Code of Fair Practice was originally written and published by The Joint\nEthics Committee in 1948 for the graphic communications industry. It was\nrevised in 1989 and has been used by thousands of artist professionals as a\nguide to creating equitable business relationships with their clients.\nFollowing the articles of the code will help you create “win-win”\nrelationships with your clients as you both agree to engage in an ethical and\nprofessional relationship.\n\nThe word “artist” is meant to apply to any seller of “art,” including graphic\ndesign, photography, illustration, and other related professions. For our\npurposes, the word “buyer” means “client.”\n\n**The Code of Fair Practice**\n\nARTICLE 1: Negotiations between an artist or the artist’s representative and a\nclient shall be conducted only through an authorized buyer.\n\nARTICLE 2: Orders or agreements between an artist or artist’s representative\nand buyer should be in writing and shall include the specific rights which are\nbeing transferred, the specific fee arrangement agreed to by the parties,\ndelivery date, and a summarized description of the work.\n\nARTICLE 3: All changes or additions not due to the fault of the artist or\nartist’s representative should be billed to the buyer as an additional and\nseparate charge.\n\nARTICLE 4: There should be no charges to the buyer for revisions or retakes\nmade necessary by errors on the part of the artist or the artist’s\nrepresentative.\n\nARTICLE 5: If work commissioned by a buyer is postponed or canceled, a “kill-\nfee” should be negotiated based on time allotted, effort expended, and\nexpenses incurred. In addition, other lost work shall be considered.\n\nARTICLE 6: Completed work shall be promptly paid for in full and the artwork\nshall be returned promptly to the artist. Payment due the artist shall not be\ncontingent upon third-party approval or payment.\n\nARTICLE 7: Alterations shall not be made without consulting the artist. Where\nalterations or retakes are necessary, the artist shall be given the\nopportunity of making such changes.\n\nARTICLE 8: The artist shall notify the buyer of any anticipated delay in\ndelivery. Should the artist fail to keep the contract through unreasonable\ndelay or nonconformance with agreed specifications, it will be considered a\nbreach of contract by the artist. Should the agreed timetable be delayed due\nto the buyer’s failure, the artist should endeavor to adhere as closely as\npossible to the original schedule as other commitments permit.\n\nARTICLE 9: Whenever practical, the buyer of artwork shall provide the artist\nwith samples of the reproduced artwork for self-promotion purposes.\n\nARTICLE 10: There shall be no undisclosed rebates, discounts, gifts, or\nbonuses requested by or given to buyers by the artist or representative.\n\nARTICLE 11: Artwork and copyright ownership are vested in the hands of the\nartist unless agreed to in writing. No works shall be duplicated, archived, or\nscanned without the artist’s prior authorization.\n\nARTICLE 12: Original artwork, and any material object used to store a computer\nfile containing original artwork, remains the property of the artist unless it\nis specifically purchased. It is distinct from the purchase of any\nreproduction rights.(*1) All transactions shall be in writing.\n\nARTICLE 13: In case of copyright transfers, only specified rights are\ntransferred. All unspecified rights remain vested with the artist. All\ntransactions shall be in writing.\n\nARTICLE 14: Commissioned artwork is not to be considered as “work for hire”\nunless agreed to in writing before work begins.\n\nARTICLE 15: When the price of work is based on limited use and later such work\nis used more extensively, the artist shall receive additional payment.\n\nARTICLE 16: Art or photography should not be copied for any use, including\nclient presentation or “comping,” without the artist’s prior authorization. If\nexploratory work, comprehensives, or preliminary photographs from an\nassignment are subsequently chosen for reproduction, the artist’s permission\nshall be secured and the artist shall receive fair additional payment.\n\nARTICLE 17: If exploratory work, comprehensives, or photographs are bought\nfrom an artist with the intention or possibility that another artist will be\nassigned to do the finished work, this shall be in writing at the time of\nplacing the order.\n\nARTICLE 18: Electronic rights are separate from traditional media, and shall\nbe separately negotiated. In the absence of a total copyright transfer or a\nwork-for-hire agreement, the right to reproduce artwork in media not yet\ndiscovered is subject to negotiation.\n\nARTICLE 19: All published illustrations and photographs should be accompanied\nby a line crediting the artist by name, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.\n\nARTICLE 20: The right of an illustrator to sign work and to have the signature\nappear in all reproductions should remain intact.\n\nARTICLE 21: There shall be no plagiarism of any artwork.\n\nARTICLE 22: If an artist is specifically requested to produce any artwork\nduring unreasonable working hours, fair additional remuneration shall be paid.\n\nARTICLE 23: All artwork or photography submitted as samples to a buyer should\nbear the name of the artist or artists responsible for the work. An artist\nshall not claim authorship of another’s work.\n\nARTICLE 24: All companies that receive artist portfolios, samples, etc., shall\nbe responsible for the return of the portfolio to the artist in the same\ncondition as received.\n\nARTICLE 25: An artist entering into an agreement with a representative for\nexclusive representation shall not accept an order from nor permit work to be\nshown by any other representative. Any agreement that is not intended to be\nexclusive should set forth the exact restrictions agreed upon between the\nparties.\n\nARTICLE 26: Severance of an association between artist and representative\nshould be agreed to in writing. The agreement should take into consideration\nthe length of time the parties have worked together as well as the\nrepresentative’s financial contribution to any ongoing advertising or\npromotion. No representative should continue to show an artist’s samples after\nthe termination of an association.\n\nARTICLE 27: Examples of an artist’s work furnished to a representative or\nsubmitted to a prospective buyer shall remain the property of the artist,\nshould not be duplicated without the artist’s authorization, and shall be\nreturned promptly to the artist in good condition.\n\nARTICLE 28:(*2) Interpretation of the Code for the purposes of arbitration\nshall be in the hands of a body designated to resolve the dispute, and is\nsubject to changes and additions at the discretion of the parent organizations\nthrough their appointed representatives on the Committee. Arbitration by a\ndesignated body shall be binding among the parties, and decisions may be\nentered for judgment and execution.\n\nARTICLE 29: Work on speculation: Contests. Artists and designers who accept\nspeculative assignments (whether directly from a client or by entering a\ncontest or competition) risk losing anticipated fees, expenses, and the\npotential opportunity to pursue other, rewarding assignments. Each artist\nshall decide individually whether to enter art contests or design\ncompetitions, provide free services, work on speculation, or work on a\ncontingency basis.\n\n_(*1) Artwork ownership, copyright ownership, and ownership and rights\ntransferred after January 1, 1978, are to be in compliance with the Federal\nCopyright Revision Act of 1976._\n\n_(*2) The original Article 28 has been deleted and replaced by Article 29._\n\nPer the contract templates in _The Graphic Artists Guild Handbook: Pricing &\nEthical Guidelines,_ we include a line in the Terms & Conditions section of\nour proposals to ensure that both ourselves and our clients agree to adhere to\nthese industry standard guidelines. A simple line like the following will\nusually suffice:\n\n**_Code of Fair Practice_**\n\n_The Client and the Designer agree to comply with the provisions of the Code\nof Fair Practice as published by the Joint Ethics Committee in 1948 and\nrevised in 1989._\n\nOne of the beauties of utilizing the Code of Fair Practice in your proposals\nis that it is not your code. These are industry standard guidelines that have\nexisted since 1948. You didn’t invent them and neither did your attorney.\nWhile any contract can be modified in writing, and this is no different,\nbeware of any client who requests to change any of these articles. A client\nwho does not agree to abide by the Code of Fair Practice could be a potential\nnightmare in your future. If a client wants to change any of the legal terms\nof your contract, consult an attorney to ensure that the terms you agree upon\nwith your client have both parties’ interests mutually represented.\n\n\n## 90\\. Contractual Mumbo Jumbo\n\nGraphic designers as a collective breed typically dislike the legalities of\nthe business. I’m sure we all would admit that we’d prefer simply creating\nsomething really cool versus the reality of life, which sometimes consists of\nhaggling with clients over the contract points of a project. Unfortunately\nalmost every graphic designer I’ve met claims to be a “freelancer,” and as a\nresult they must have some knowledge of how to put together a contract.\n\nFor the first several years that my company was in business, our proposals\ncontained no terms and conditions. Somehow we muddled through hundreds of\nprojects without getting into any trouble. Our clients paid. We never had to\ntalk to an attorney. It all seemed too easy. Then the projects started getting\nbigger, the financials became larger, and the timelines were longer. It became\napparent that we needed to become more structured or we were going to get\nstung by a deceitful client (which inevitably did happen, more than once).\n\nHere is your first step to success: You must own a copy of _The Graphic\nArtists Guild Handbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines_. Purchase the latest\nedition (a new one comes out every few years). If you don’t own it, stop what\nyou are doing right now and order a copy. _The Graphic Artists Guild Handbook_\nis filled with information to help cultivate and sharpen your business savvy.\n\n![Image](../images/00122.jpeg)\n\nToward the back of each edition of the book is a section called “Standard\nContracts & Business Tools.” This section discusses in great detail the\ndifferent contract types, payment issues, negotiation approaches, and legal\nissues facing designers today. It also contains numerous contracts and forms\nfor you to use as a springboard for your own business. Read that section.\nUnless you have your own attorney and customized solutions for your contracts,\nuse those guidelines. I know it may be boring at first, but you must educate\nyourself on standard contract points so you don’t open yourself up to\npotentially getting cheated by a malicious client. They are out there, like\nFreddy Krueger, just waiting for you to fall asleep.\n\n\n## 91\\. “Etcetera” Has No Business in Your Business\n\n[Dictionary.com](http://Dictionary.com) tells us that the word “etcetera” is\nused to stand for a number of unspecified things or persons. It can also refer\nto extras or sundries. In other words, you can use it to avoid being specific.\nNot a great idea for your business.\n\nAny lawyer reading this will likely think, “Of course. You should never put\n“etc.” in your business documentation.” Unfortunately, most of us don’t have\nlawyers. My agency completed over 1,500 projects in our first ten years. I\njust conducted some research on past proposals and found the word “etc.”\nappeared in 80 percent of the proposals we had sent in our first five years!\n(We have since abandoned this bad habit.) Fortunately, we’ve never been stung\nby this practice.\n\nHere are a few embarrassing examples pulled from website and game proposals\nwe’ve sent to our clients:\n\n_“The page will include standard MySpace features and links (Add to Friends,\nAdd to Favorites, Forums, Comments,_ **_etc._**_).”_\n\n_“Users will be able to choose a frame, background, skin,_ **_etc._**_, for\neach of their cases.”_\n\n_“Multiple game levels each with their own theme. For example, the user can\nbegin in the Dressing Room and progress through themed levels to eventually\narrive at Center Stage—progressive levels can include: Backstage, Make-up,_\n**_etc._**_”_\n\n_“You could lose one if you run into a creepy object (spider, skull,_\n**_etc._**_) or a booby trap.”_\n\n_“The mini games & training could be graphically represented by tents, race\ntracks, carnival stands,_ **_etc._**_”_\n\nThe problem arises when it comes time to interpret exactly what “etc.” means.\nWhat if the client interprets “etc.” to mean, “Creation of video chat\ntechnology to be utilized for distribution of the website or game via mobile\ndevices?” If that is not what you meant by the word “etc.,” then you’re in\ntrouble!\n\nWhen writing proposals, the word “etcetera” should not be part of your\nvocabulary. You must clearly define in exact detail what will be a part of the\nproject expectations and how things will be created. While you’re at it, be\nsure to avoid some words and phrases such as _and_ _so on, and so forth,\nstuff, other things, additional items,_ and similar ambiguous phrases that\nwill certainly get you into trouble at some point in your relationship with a\nclient.\n\n![Image](../images/00123.jpeg)\n\n\n## 92\\. You Don’t Have to Sign Off on This\n\nMost of the freelancers and graphic design business owners whom I know are not\nformally trained in business practices. As a result, being taken advantage of\nby sneaky clients happens all too frequently. I know for certain that it has\nhappened in my company.\n\nAfter a few years of existence, our agency had an attorney write up a set of\nTerms & Conditions to be included in all of our proposals. It cost us $500 and\nwe felt like we were growing up. “Check us out! We hired a lawyer for\nsomething.”\n\nMost of our prospective clients said nothing about these new additions to our\nproposals, and we were glad they were there “just in case” something got ugly\nwith a project. We felt protected by our fancy Terms & Conditions.\n\nOur problem, and the problem with most small agencies and freelancers, is that\nwe would agree to throw out our Terms & Conditions anytime a prospective\nclient asked us to. We felt like we had to agree to the terms that our client\nwanted to have in place in order to gain the green light on the project. We\nwere hungry for the work and, quite frankly, willing to do anything to land\nit—even if that meant putting ourselves legally into harm’s way.\n\nThe reality is that when a client sends you new Terms & Conditions to insert\ninto your proposal, YOU DON’T HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON IT. And you are better off\nnot signing off on your client’s sometimes lopsided terms than you would be if\nyou landed the project and set yourself up for potential trouble down the\nroad.\n\n![Image](../images/00124.jpeg)\n\nAn client once approached us with a large project. We were really excited\nabout the project and worked hard to win it. It was a happy day when they gave\nus a verbal green light. The final hurdle was that they wanted to remove our\nTerms & Conditions and insert their own. This project was over $100,000 and\nour “junior mindset” led us to say, “No problem! Send over your terms and\nwe’ll put them into the proposal for sign-off.” When their terms came over, we\npulled out our 19 terms that filled the space of one page and inserted their\ncustom-written terms that filled three full pages of our proposal (at 9-point\ntype!).\n\n![Image](../images/00125.jpeg)\n\nMonths later, this client turned out to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and we\nneeded to get out of the project before it dragged down our whole office\nculture. We began to review their terms more closely and realized we were in\ntrouble by the legal language contained therein:\n\n_6) Vendor represents and warrants that:_\n\n_(i) it will perform Services in a good, workmanlike, and professional manner\nconsistent with highest industry standards and applicable laws and\nregulations;_\n\n_(ii) Services will be performed in strict compliance with the terms of this\nAgreement;_\n\n_(iii) neither the performance of Services nor the use of any Work Product, as\ndefined herein, will in any way violate or infringe upon any third party\nrights, including rights regarding ownership, trade secrets, trademarks,\ncopyright or patents; and_\n\n_(iv) it will protect, promote and preserve the goodwill associated with the\nCompany trade name and any Company customer and/or vendor relationships in\nconnection with its performance of Services and/or New Services hereunder._\n\n_7) In the event of a breach of Section 6, the Company, at its sole option and\nat the Vendor’s sole expense, can either require Vendor to re-perform the\nServices, which may include modifying the Deliverable, or generate new\nDeliverable, or refund all amounts paid under this Agreement._\n\n* * *\n\nYOU ARE BETTER OFF NOT\n\nWORKING WITH THE CLIENT\n\nTHAN SIGNING AN AGREEMENT\n\nTHAT TURNS\n\nINTO A NIGHTMARE.\n\n* * *\n\nIn layman’s terms, the above says, “If they don’t like our work they can have\nus redo it or ask for all their money back!” Why in the world would anyone\nsign off on this? (Yet we did. And many of you reading this would have signed\noff on it, too. After all, we felt like we had to go along with it in order to\nland the work). Their terms were filled with additional lopsided legal lines\nthat protected them and put us in a completely submissive position.\n\n![Image](../images/00126.jpeg)\n\nA healthy agreement protects the interests of both parties. At some point in\nyour career, a prospective client will undoubtedly present you with Terms &\nConditions that smell a little funny. When this inevitably happens, trust your\ninstinct. If it seems lopsided, it probably is lopsided. Remember, YOU DON’T\nHAVE TO SIGN OFF ON _ANYTHING_. Consult with an attorney. You are better off\nnot working with the client than signing an agreement that turns into a\nnightmare. After explaining this principle to our office manager, Rachel, she\nexclaimed, “Stick to your guns and have pride in your company!” (I wish this\nopinion had been present before we signed off on that nightmare client’s\nterms.)\n\n\n## 93\\. B.A.M. Lists\n\nAugust 2006 was a dark month in our company history. Our work had piled up\nfaster than we were able to staff against it. Our young team of designers and\nprogrammers were tasting something at our company that we had not yet\nexperienced: brutally long work hours. The team dubbed this month “Black\nAugust.”\n\nMost successful agencies have horror stories of frantic all-nighters, racing\nto hit looming deadlines. Our agency has been in a constant battle to solve\nthis notorious problem and its associated issues: How do you staff up fast\nenough to manage spikes in the production load, and how do you reduce overhead\nwhen the spike is over?\n\nOur solution is the B.A.M. list. B.A.M. stands for “Black August Munitions.”\nIt is simply a list of freelancers categorized by their expertise. When we\ndecide that a freelancer has the skills to help our business, we ask them to\nstop by and fill out all the necessary paperwork (W-9, Confidentiality\nAgreement, and so one, congruent with their level of potential involvement\nwith our company). By having them complete the necessary paperwork in advance\nof us needing them for production, there is nothing standing in the way when\nthe time comes for us to use them.\n\nEvery time work starts piling up, we determine whether we feel it is a spike\nor if it is sustainable growth. If it is a spike, we pull out the B.A.M. list.\nWe search for the appropriate freelancer and then bring them in to help manage\nthe load.\n\n_So what does this have to do with you?_\n\nIf you are a business owner or independent freelancer, make a B.A.M. list and\ndistribute it to everyone in your company. Oftentimes, it is an employee\nburied in work who needs the reminder that there are freelance resources\navailable.\n\nIf you are a freelancer looking for work, get on the B.A.M. list of agencies\nin your area. A simple email containing the following should help get things\nrolling:\n\n_“I am emailing you today because I feel that I would be a great fit to help\nsupport your overflow work. I was curious if you had a list of freelancers\nthat you use to support your company; if so, I would love to be added to that\nlist. I’d be happy to swing by your office, briefly show you my portfolio, and\nsign a nondisclosure agreement or whatever else you would need me to do to be\nconsidered for overflow work. It seems every successful agency has times when\nthe workload gets heavy. Next time that happens for you, I would love to be\nready to pitch in.”_\n\n![Image](../images/00127.jpeg)\n\n\n## 94\\. One Line That Changed Everything about Collections\n\nGetting paid can sometimes be a traumatic experience for a freelancer or a\nsmall business. Typically, we email invoices to our clients and they push them\nthrough their accounts payable system. If your client is a small business,\ngetting paid on time often has everything to do with whether they have money\nor not. If you are working with a big corporation, getting paid on time has\neverything to do with their accounts payable practices.\n\nIn my early freelance years, I would send an invoice and then wait for the\ncheck to come approximately 30 days later. When the payment didn’t show up, I\nwould politely send an email to the client to inquire about the late invoice.\nThe client would then say they needed to check with accounts payable on the\npayment status. Soon after, I would receive a reply letting me know when to\nexpect payment. I never knew for sure what happened after I hung up the phone\nwith my contact. Did they actually call accounts payable? Did they realize\nthey had never submitted the invoice in the first place?\n\nThere was a stretch of a couple years where over half of all invoices we sent\nwere not paid on time. When you are trying to run a business, cash flow is\nking. When clients pay late, it stings the pocketbook. One particular payment\ntook over six months to collect! First my contact couldn’t find the invoice.\nThen their accounts payable division lost it. Once the accounts payable\ndivision finally found it, they sat on it for a few weeks. It was miserable.\n\nWe have since changed our entire billing system, which in turn changed our\ncollections. Now we collect 90 percent of our payments on time. The magic\nhappened when we added one simple line to our email as we sent the invoice to\nthe client:\n\n_“Please confirm receipt of this invoice so that we can track it properly in\nour accounting system.”_\n\nThat line is money in the bank, literally! Wait approximately 24 hours and if\nthe client has not replied to your email confirming receipt, then send them an\nemail with this line in it:\n\n_“I just wanted to follow up and make sure you received the invoice I sent\nyesterday. Please let me know when you get a moment.”_\n\nAnd if the client doesn’t reply to that email, then a phone call is in order.\nThe trick to collecting on time comes by seeing the invoice submission all the\nway through. You must push that invoice through at the time of submission,\nrather than waiting until it is finally due.\n\nBy getting the client to confirm receipt, it entices the client to actually\nreact to the invoice, to print it out if necessary, and to submit to their\naccounts payable team. The point is that your clients will be more likely to\nreply to you and feel an obligation to take the necessary steps to get you\npaid.\n\nAn added bonus is that you rarely have to feel like the repo man trying to\ncollect your late monies. You’re simply following up on your friendly email.\nIt is the accounting system you are using that requires confirmation, not you.\n\nTry it. It works!\n\n\n## 95\\. A Business Is an Organism That Wants to Die\n\nI am looking for a replacement for our art director...again. While employee\nturnover is not too common at our company, it does happen. We have people who\ncome and work for us for a year or two; they build up their portfolio, get\nnoticed by other firms, and then move on. As I plowed through resumes in\nsearch of our new art director, I was reminded that a business is an organism\nthat wants to die. A business often seems like a lemming, doing all it can to\njump off the cliff and end its life.\n\nThere are times when things are good in a graphic design business. The phone\nis ringing. Work is piling up. You need a bulldozer to help sort the stacks of\nmoney. These times also come with challenges. The workload starts to cause\nlate nights for you and your employees, and the fast-paced production causes\nthings to slip through the cracks. You miss a deadline. Your quality drops on\na project or two. Clients begin to be frustrated, and all of a sudden you have\ngrumpy employees who are polishing their résumés and looking for new\nopportunities. Your success is now killing your business!\n\nOther times, things are obviously rough. The phone is not ringing, causing you\nand your employees to spend the day twiddling your thumbs, hoping and\nsometimes praying that you’ll get some work. You try some advertising but\nnothing seems to work. Your lack of success is now killing your business!\n\nGood times, bad times, it doesn’t matter: Your business is an organism that\nwants to die. This may seem like a negative point of view, and perhaps it is,\nbut I found that once I came to this understanding my role seemed clearer. My\njob as a freelancer-turned-business-owner was to provide 24/7 CPR support for\nmy business. Once I realized that my role was to keep my business alive in\nspite of its desire to jump off a cliff, things became considerably less\nstressful.\n\n![Image](../images/00128.jpeg)\n\nInstead of being shocked that an employee decides to move on to another\ncompany, I think, “It must be time for a little CPR.” Rather than getting\nangry that a client didn’t choose us for a big project, I think, “It is time\nto get out the defibrillator.” My expectation is that my business will require\na medical diagnosis and a little CPR every day to keep it alive. Every day it\nseems there is some type of CPR necessary: You need to send out another\nproposal, find a new employee, call a frustrated client, fix a broken process,\ntalk an employee off a ledge, analyze the financial numbers, design a new\nmarketing piece, replace a broken computer, buy some new software, learn\nsomething you don’t already know...this is the daily CPR that you provide to\nyour business to keep it alive. Your arms might get tired, but keeping the\nlemmings on the cliff can be fun if you do it with a positive attitude and a\nvision of the success that lies ahead.\n\nThe real trick in business is getting your business to stay alive without your\ndaily CPR. This requires processes, leadership, and the right team. It took me\nten years to get my company to this point and it is truly gratifying.\n\n* * *\n\nGOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES,\n\nIT DOESN’T MATTER:\n\nYOUR BUSINESS\n\nIS AN ORGANISM THAT\n\nWANTS TO DIE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 96\\. If I’ve Got a Dollar, You’ve Got a Dollar, but No Partners\n\nAbout a year after I started freelancing, the owners of a local design agency\nasked me to go to lunch. We had a great chat and I walked away surprised at\nhow many similarities there were in what we were doing. They had been in\nbusiness for a couple years, and we both had entertainment-industry client\nrelationships that had been cultivated from both of us living in Los Angeles\nduring the same years. It seemed we were living parallel lives.\n\nShortly after our lunch, the owners of this agency took an aggressive approach\nto try to get me to merge with them. My family was invited to their company\nparty. We wore their agency t-shirts. They broke down the financials and\nspelled it all out so I could see “how great” it would be. The temptation was\ngreat. At the time I was billing a little over $200K per year as a solo\nfreelancer. I knew I had to grow, but had no idea how to do it. The thought of\npartnering with them would solve a lot of my future problems, and would make\nit so I didn’t have to go through the fear of hiring my own team and growing\nmy business by myself.\n\nI spent a couple weeks mulling over my dilemma. At a get-together with my\nwife’s extended family, I talked with my wife’s grandpa about my situation. He\nis the type of “sage grandpa” who has all the answers from a lifetime of\nsuccess in business. He heard me out and then shared a story with me about\nwhen he was young in his career.\n\nHe had worked his way up to where he was running a significant portion of the\nlargest construction business in the Salt Lake City area. He started thinking\nthat he deserved some partnership in the company, and he approached the owner\nof the construction company with a proposal for just that. He then shared with\nme a quote that was the answer to my struggle, “Bill, if I’ve got a dollar,\nyou’ve got a dollar, but no partners.” The owner of the company was more than\nwilling to treat my wife’s grandpa like a partner, but not to bestow legal\npartnership upon him. My wife’s grandfather ended up starting his own\nconstruction company, which made him millions of dollars during his working\nyears.\n\nI decided this was my answer. I would proceed with the mindset that I would be\nbetter off hanging on to 100 percent of my own thing rather than partnering\nwith another agency and having only a small percentage of something that could\npotentially grow bigger.\n\nI kept my eye on that agency over the years and even went to lunch with them a\ncouple times to talk shop. It seemed they were doing well, and so were we.\nBoth our agencies grew to the same size, around 15 employees at that time, and\nboth doing cool work for cool clients.\n\nThen, seven years after this agency had courted me, I had lunch with them\nagain. One of the owners had left the company to do other things. The owner\nthat was left behind began to tell me the full scope of their trials. They had\nnot had one profitable year since their inception. My company, on the other\nhand, had been profitable every year. They were on the brink of closing their\ndoors. We were maintaining profitability in spite of being in the worst\neconomy since the Great Depression. I was overwhelmed with a feeling of\ngratitude that I had made the right choice all those years earlier. It turns\nout that this agency closed their doors, while my agency is still thriving.\n\nI have people at my company now who are in the same shoes as my wife’s\ngrandfather—deserving of a partnership. I treat them like partners. They share\nin the profits and decision making of the company. But there is no legal\npartnership. They have all the upsides of partnership without the liabilities.\nIf I’ve got a dollar, they’ve got a dollar.\n\nWith a partnership it is easy to get lopsided in contribution. One partner\nworks more hours. Another partner seemingly brings more to the table. How do\nyou decide to fairly distribute dividends? Who wins the debate when you want\nto shift directions in the company? I’m not saying that partnerships can’t\nwork; there are countless examples that show when partnering is the perfect\nsolution. I am just cautioning you to make sure the merger is mutually\nbeneficial and to work out all the details in advance. This will help save any\npotential heartache and disappointment down the line.\n\nOn the flip side of caution, in 2011 I was approached by Mark Long, the owner\nof a successful photo restoration company, about partnering together. We\nstarted a small design agency utilizing offshore designers to produce low-cost\ngraphic design services for small businesses. While the business presents\nunique challenges, the partnership has been one of the most rewarding business\nrelationships of my career.\n\nI’m certainly not trying to say you should never partner with anyone. I’m\nsimply saying, “Be careful and choose wisely.” The right partner and\ncomplementing strengths and weaknesses can certainly lead you to great\nsuccess.\n\n\n## 97\\. If You Want to Win the Game, You Have to Know the Score\n\nThe first time I heard about the E-Myth was straight from the horse’s mouth. I\nhad been freelancing for about a year when the acclaimed author Michael Gerber\ncame to our state to speak at a business expo I was attending. He was\nenergetic and filled with wisdom. I was intrigued. Shortly thereafter, I\npicked up his book _The E-Myth Revisited_. If you are a business owner and\nhave not read it, shame on you. Even if you don’t own a business, Mr. Gerber’s\ninsights and advice are of great benefit to any working person.\n\nSeveral parts of the book had a profound impact on me. One is his instruction\non creating “Information Systems” for your business. In a very concise\nexplanation, the numbers you track tell you the story of your business.\n\n_“In short, the Information System could tell you the things you need to know!\nThe things you don’t know now...It tells you when and why you need to change.\nWithout it, you might as well put on a blindfold, have someone turn you around\nthree times, and set out with a dart in your hand, waiting for a signal from\nthe heavens to throw it. Not a very promising game. But one, it seems, most\npeople in small business are determined to play.”_\n\n—The E-Myth Revisited, _1995, 248–249_\n\nTHE E-MYTH REVISITED by MICHAEL E. GERBER. Copyright (c) 1995, 2001 by Michael\nE. Gerber. Reprinted by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nI was inspired. I met with my brand-new office manager and read her a few\nexcerpts from the book. We pulled out a spreadsheet and made up a list of\nthings we would start tracking. I remember saying, “Someday all of this data\nwill tell us a story that will help us make decisions for our business.”\nSeveral years later, that list of data became a crystal ball for our business.\nWe review the most recent data at the start of each month and have been able\nto make accurate assumptions as to what the future has in store for us.\n\n**Information We Track Monthly**\n\n• How much did we bill (revenue)?\n\n• How much did we cost (expenses)?\n\n• How much profit (or loss) did we make?\n\n• How many estimates did we send?\n\n• What was the average cost per estimate?\n\n• How many estimates were green lit?\n\n• What was the average cost per estimate that received a green light?\n\n• How many invoices did we send?\n\n• What was the average cost per invoice?\n\n• How much money are we waiting to collect (receivables)?\n\n• How much money is overdue for payment?\n\n• How many man-hours did it take to complete our projects this month?\n\n• How much did we cost per production hour (the hourly burn rate)?\n\n• How much did each employee cost per hour/per day?\n\n• How much money is in each account at the end of the month?\n\n• How many days before the first of the month did we have enough money green\nlit to cover costs?\n\n• How many working projects do we have that have yet to be invoiced?\n\n• Who were our first-, second-, and third-largest clients in the month (based\non dollars billed)?\n\n• How much did we spend on advertising this month?\n\n• What were our payroll costs?\n\n• How much were overhead costs (excluding payroll)?\n\n• When did employees receive raises and how much did that amount to?\n\nMany of these items are plotted on a line graph. This helps us recognize\ntrends in the data. Over several years of tracking this information, we now\nknow important things about our business, such as\n\n• June, July, August, and September are our busiest months.\n\n• One of those months will be 40 to 60 percent higher than what we bill in\nJanuary.\n\n• December is always our most expensive month.\n\n• December or January is usually our lowest billing month.\n\n• There is a direct correlation between the number of proposals we send out\nand the amount of money we bill. (This goes without saying, but we see the\nhard numbers and can then react appropriately.)\n\n• Money spent on advertising does not have a direct correlation with the\namount of money we bill (in the short term).\n\nThese are just a few of the things we know about our business from the data we\ntrack. This information helps make important business decisions. If you want\nto win the game, you have to know the score.\n\n\n## 98\\. There Is No Such Thing as a “Meet and Greet”\n\nWe’ve had some embarrassing moments in our company history. A few years ago,\nwe had been asked to participate in the bidding process for a big project for\nDisney. This was an exciting project with six-figure dollars attached. We were\nfinally starting to feel like we were being asked to play with the big boys.\nOur team put the proposal together, which got Disney interested enough that\nthey asked us to fly out to Burbank for a “meet and greet.” Two of our team\nmembers were designated to go; they printed out a few copies of the proposal\nand jumped on a plane. To their surprise, what was named a “meet and greet” by\nour Disney contact actually turned out to be a conference room full of\nexecutives waiting to hear our team’s pitch. The Disney execs expected to be\nwowed by our organization and preparation. Instead, they were likely joking\nabout our idiocy after our team left. A few copies of a printed proposal and\nan ad-hoc presentation about how our team would execute on the project were\nnot enough to impress someone’s family pet, let alone a group of powerful,\nintelligent executives.\n\n![Image](../images/00129.jpeg)\n\nThis experience, combined with a few other awkward meetings, has taught us the\nvaluable lesson that there is no such thing as a “meet and greet.” Every\nmeeting, every interaction, every time you have an audience, you should be\nprepared to present what makes you and/or your company so awesome. This means\nyou should always be prepared with some, any, or all of the following: a\npresentation, a photo gallery of portfolio samples, a printed portfolio book\n(don’t always assume you’ll have a computer or Internet access), a brochure\nabout your business, a list of questions about your audience’s company, or\nperhaps a diagram of how you approach a typical project. Even a stone tablet\nwith chiseled dreams and goals is better than nothing. Whatever it is, the\nmoral of this story is to ALWAYS BE PREPARED.\n\n* * *\n\nEVERY MEETING,\n\nEVERY INTERACTION,\n\nEVERY TIME\n\nYOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE,\n\nYOU SHOULD BE PREPARED\n\nTO PRESENT WHAT MAKES\n\nYOU AND/OR\n\nYOUR COMPANY\n\nSO AWESOME.\n\n* * *\n\nIn my experience, meet and greets just don’t exist. But if you do happen to\nhave that first meeting in the history of design where the only thing that\npotential client wants to do is shake your hand and talk sports, then at least\nall of the great tools end up sitting under the table in your laptop bag ready\nfor action if called upon.\n\n\n## 99\\. How to Make a Capabilities Presentation\n\nA mere eight years into the creation of my graphic design business and I felt\nlike we were finally getting on the right track with business development. As\nI originally wrote this a few years ago, I was sitting in JFK Airport heading\nhome from a successful trip that was filled with business meetings with\nexecutives at entertainment companies and advertising agencies in New York\nCity. Until this point, we had been fortunate to land work without much\neffort. New clients would be referred to our company, and we would magically\nget the green light on projects. Unfortunately, due to the economic downturn\nof 2008 and 2009, we now had to work hard for work. On this trip we were ready\nto put our best, most polished foot forward.\n\nA few weeks prior to our trip, we were invited by NBC to give a “capabilities\npresentation” to one of their marketing teams. At the time we didn’t have one\nprepared so we spent about a week working up our presentation. The fact that\nwe didn’t have a canned capabilities presentation at our company after\nchurning successful projects for eight years leads me to believe that many of\nthe freelancers and small design business owners reading this book don’t have\none either.\n\nThe objective of a capabilities presentation is to tell the potential client\n“Who You Are” and “What You Do.” So don’t beat around the bush; come right out\nand tell them. We build our presentations in Apple’s Keynote software, but it\ncould just as easily be created in PowerPoint or any other related software.\nWhat is important is the flow of information.\n\n**Slide 1: Who We Are**\n\n**Slide 2: “Our Team”**\n\nWe show a quirky photo of our team, and we share with the client a brief\nhistory of our company and the awards we’ve won. For freelancers, I don’t\nadvise putting a photo of yourself on a slide like this—it might be kind of\nawkward to be sitting there with a potential client showing off a picture of\nyourself. In this situation, you can share info about yourself on Slide 1.\n\n**Slide 3: Client Logos**\n\nWe share a few phrases about the clients we have worked with and about how\nmany projects we’ve done over the years. If you are a freelancer and don’t\nhave anything “fancy” to share, you can skip a slide like this. The next few\nslides are designed to give your potential client an overview of what you have\nto offer and show work examples to support your capabilities.\n\n**Slide 4: We Do Branding**\n\nOn the We Do slides like this, we share an overview of the services we\nprovide. In this case, we tell them we design logos and style guides to create\na unique “look and feel” for a business.\n\n**Slide 5: Branding Example 1**\n\nIn our presentation, this slide contains four screenshots of a style guide we\ndid for a Fox property. In a few brief seconds, we explain information about\nthe project and then move on to the next slide.\n\n**Slide 6: Branding Example 2**\n\n**Slide 7: Branding Example 3**\n\nEach Example slide contains a few nicely organized screenshots of the example\nproject on the right side of the screen. On the left side of the screen is a\nbulleted list of five or six key points about the project. Don’t bore your\nclient by piling on tons of slides and examples to support each section of\nWhat You Do; a couple is all you really need. We feel like three is a good\nnumber.\n\n**Slide 8: We Do Print Design**\n\n**Slide 9: Print Example 1**\n\n**Slide 10: Print Example 2**\n\n**Slide 11: Print Example 3**\n\nTry to select examples that show variety in what you have to offer. For\nexample, in the Print Design section you may show a brochure project for\nexample 1, an annual report for example 2, and a stationery package for\nexample 3.\n\n**Slide 12: We Do Web Development**\n\n**Slide 13: Web Example 1**\n\n**Slide 14: Web Example 2**\n\n**Slide 15: Web Example 3**\n\nFor our Web Development section, we select high-profile projects we’ve\ncreated, while keeping in mind some of the different programming languages and\ntools we are capable of working with. You want the client to walk away with a\ngood sense of your core skill set.\n\n**Slide 16: We Do Online Games**\n\n**Slide 17: Game Example 1**\n\n**Slide 18: Game Example 2**\n\n**Slide 19: Game Example 3**\n\nIn this section, like with Web Development, we also make an effort to show a\nvariety of programming languages and brands we have worked with.\n\n**Slide 20: Summary**\n\nTo wrap up the capabilities presentation, we have a slide that contains a\nlisting of each category we reviewed with the client, as well as a few bullet\npoints underneath each item detailing what we offer. We briefly run through a\nfew of the items that we feel are of the most interest to the client.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when you give your capabilities\npresentation to a potential client.\n\n**Be respectful of their time.** Practice giving the presentation in 3-, 10-,\nand 15-minute versions. When you sit down with the potential client, ask them\nhow long they have and then give them the appropriate version of the\npresentation. Don’t be too wordy. Even though you may be really excited about\nthe amount and quality of the work you have to show them, your potential\nclient may not share that same enthusiasm.\n\n**Be brief and informative as you discuss your capabilities and projects.**\nFocus on results. Good design is always fun to show, but most clients are\ninterested in results. Make sure you have quantifiable results to share about\nsome of the work you show. Phrases like, “The year after we rebranded this\nclient, their company grew by 30 percent,” or, “After we launched this site,\nthey had over one million unique visitors in the first week alone,” are great\nthings to be able to say as you present to the client. Watch their body\nlanguage. If they are getting fidgety, not asking questions, or looking at\ntheir watch, you may want to hurry things up. A great way to bomb your\ncapabilities presentation is to bore your client and waste their time. You are\nbetter off speeding through it and following up with them at a later date.\nThat said, be sure that you have a leave-behind.\n\nWe usually leave a brochure with our clients that outlines a few project\nexamples and offers brief information about our company. Yours may just be a\nsimple flyer. Whatever you choose, a creative giveaway is always a good way to\nleave a positive impact. A freelancer once gave us a custom-printed skateboard\nwith our company logo on it; this type of thing is a great reminder of who\nthey are and the work that they do, and doesn’t get thrown away. A\ncapabilities presentation is an awesome way to “sell” your services.\n\n![Image](../images/00130.jpeg)\n\n\n## 100\\. Floods Happen\n\nThe first three of my four self-employment years consisted of me slaving away\nin my basement. Forty-hour weeks became eighty-hour weeks, and my stress level\nwas through the roof. My wife found and convinced me to hire my first\nemployee, and my mother-in-law found my second employee. It was as if they\nwere bringing home stray puppies for me to adopt.\n\nMy basement office was at maximum capacity with three workstations—one in each\ncorner of the room—and a small television in the fourth corner to keep me\ncompany late at night. It didn’t take long for us to realize that we needed to\nfind some office space. My conservative nature led me to find some cheap space\njust down the street from my home. We signed a one-year lease and started\npacking.\n\nMoving day came and we hauled our desks down to the new office. Around mid-\nafternoon we were ready to move in our equipment. With excitement we dashed\nback to my home office to get our computers and monitors. At approximately\n5:00 P.M. we were finished. Our desks were set up. Our computers were plugged\nin and ready for a bright new future on Monday morning in our new office\nspace.\n\nApproximately 12 hours later, I was awakened by someone pounding on the front\ndoor to my home. I glanced at the clock by my bed: 5:00 A.M., “What is going\non?” I thought. I raced to the front door and recognized my neighbor outside.\nI opened the door and he yelled, “Your basement is flooding, I’m going to get\nhelp!” as he ran down the street. At that moment I recognized the sound of\nrushing water. I charged down to the basement and splashed into two feet of\nbrown water that now covered every inch of the floor. Fortunately, my\nwonderful neighbors came to the rescue and began helping to move all of the\nfurniture and stored possessions.\n\nAt the base of the mountain near my home there is an irrigation reservoir.\nSometime in the night, a chain had broken and a gate opened, which allowed the\nwater to rush out of the reservoir. The rushing water became a river flowing\nthrough streets and canals searching for lower ground. The river found my\nwalk-out basement and the water poured through our basement door.\n\n![Image](../images/00131.jpeg)\n\nThis experience taught me countless life lessons. One of the most important\nis, “FLOODS HAPPEN, YOU MUST HAVE DAILY BACKUPS OF YOUR WORK.” We didn’t. At\nthe time I had no file backups at all. I occasionally feared a hard-drive\nfailure, but never worried about it enough to back up my files on a regular\nbasis. Had my flood happened 12 hours earlier, I would have lost all the work\nstored on three workstations. All of our current projects would need to have\nbeen completely redone. All past projects would have been gone forever. It\nwould have been a disaster and I likely would have thrown in the towel on\nstarting a business and begun looking for a job. I am so grateful that I\ndidn’t have to learn this lesson the hard way.\n\nThe following week we implemented a regimented file backup strategy. We bought\nmultiple external hard drives and since that day, I keep backup drives onsite\nand offsite. My office and my home would both have to burn down on the same\nnight for our data to be lost.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to back up your data, and nowadays software makes it\nridiculously easy. I won’t go into the details of backup options. A little\nonline research can reveal many different strategies. Choose something that\nworks for you, but CHOOSE SOMETHING. If you are not backing up your computer\nfiles regularly, you could be in for serious and irreversible trouble.\n\nI don’t live in a flood plain. My home is in a neighborhood within a developed\narea. There are even several homes down a large hill from mine that would\nexpect to flood before my home. Nobody expects a flood, fire, or other\ndisaster to happen to them, but believe me, floods happen and lightning\nstrikes. You _must_ have daily backups of your work so that you are able to\nweather the storm when it inevitably comes your way.\n\n\n## 101\\. Flexibility, Not Freedom\n\nI always chuckle a little when I hear people say something along the lines of,\n“It must be nice owning a business. I would love the freedom that comes with\nthat.” I always think to myself, “Freedom! This is the furthest thing from\nfreedom. I’m a slave!” If you are considering venturing out on your own to\nfreelance or start a business, be prepared to enjoy “flexibility”...but\ndefinitely not “freedom.” This chapter is dedicated to those of you\nconsidering taking the leap and going out on your own, as an effort to prepare\nyou for the flexible yet freedom-less life you will be plunging into.\n\nIf you are an ambitious business owner, the day never really ends. There is\nalways a fire to put out or an area that you can find for improvement. In my\nearly freelance years of working 80 hours per week, I used to love the evening\nhours when clients would be out of the office. The phone would stop ringing\nand the emails would stop flowing, and I could actually focus and get some\nwork done. Now that I have a team of people in the office, my “office hours”\nare pretty normal: 40 to 50 hours per week (in office). But as an ambitious\nbusiness owner, I have the privilege of spending my evenings reading business\nbooks, discussing business issues with my wife, and working through general\nstress management issues. I can’t count the number of late-night hours I spend\njotting solutions to my problems on scratch paper by my bed, for example. (By\nthe way, many of those solutions became this book.) Don’t get me wrong. When\nyou are ambitious, this type of life actually “feeds” you.\n\nThe fruits of freelancing or owning a business are many, one of which is\nflexibility. You have the privilege of deciding which 10 to 12 plus hours per\nday you want to work. If you want to run an errand or two in the day without\nasking permission from a boss or company manager, you can. If you want to take\nyour kids to the pool on a summer afternoon, you can. You have the flexibility\nin your schedule to do that. Just know you’ll likely be working later that day\nto make up for that lost time. When you work for yourself, there is no\n“salary” to cover for missed billable hours—what you work for is exactly what\nyou will get, whether for good or for bad.\n\nIt is also important to note that for freelancers or business owners, like for\nSpider-Man, “with great power comes great responsibility.” Since your success\nis based solely on how much you put into it, it will be sometimes difficult to\ndraw the line between working hard and smart versus becoming a workaholic.\nWhile nothing great was ever achieved without hard work and enthusiasm, take\ninto consideration your health and your family situation—working 22 hours per\nday may not be the best thing for you, or it may be just fine. The important\nthing is to think through all aspects of branching out on your own so that you\nknow going into it where you plan to draw the line—both with yourself and with\nyour clients and your workload.\n\nI’m not trying to paint an ugly picture of freelancing or owning a business.\nI’m merely trying to help you understand the lifestyle choice that is before\nyou. As for me, I’ll choose flexibility over freedom any day of the week.\n\n* * *\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO,\n\nNEVER, EVER\n\nDO UNDOCUMENTED WORK...\n\nNEVER, NEVER, NEVER.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 102\\. Never Do Undocumented Work\n\nThis lesson I’ve learned many times in my graphic design career. I’m not quite\nsure why I have to learn it over and over again, since the emotional scarring\nis so painful. But, whatever you do, never, ever do undocumented work...never,\nnever, never.\n\nImagine the scenario. You sit in a conference room with your potential clients\nto discuss their logo, website, and brochure project. Over the course of an\nhour you amaze them with your ideas, creativity, and personality. You discuss\nthe budget and project scope, and they green light you to begin work right\naway. A week later they come back to your office to see your initial comps and\ndrop off their initial payment. As you begin to show them your comps of their\nlogo, website, and brochure, they remark, “Wait a minute. We thought you were\ngoing to do only the logo. We decided to hold off on the website and\nbrochure.” A cold sweat breaks across your clammy forehead. You just spent 20\nhours of your week doing comps for a project that you thought was green lit.\n\nI’m not saying you need to create a formal proposal or have a rock-solid\nemployment agreement in place before you can start working with a client or at\na new job. I’m simply saying that, by nature, people tend to have problems\nwith memory loss.\n\nThe next time you get a request to do any work from a client, take the couple\nminutes to shoot them an email that details out the project as you understand\nit to be.\n\n_Dear Lucy,_\n\n_Thanks for the call. I’m ready to jump on the project. Just to make sure we\nare on the same page, here are the details of the project: (insert details\nhere). I expect these tasks to take approximately XX hours, which equates to\nabout $XXX in fees. I’ll plan on including the hours on my next invoice to\nyou. If things start taking longer than expected, I’ll keep you posted on the\nchange in my estimated hours. Please let me know if this works for you! I’m\ngetting started right away._\n\n_George_\n\nAs this relates to taking on a new job, it may be surprising how many small\nbusiness owners don’t go through the formality of creating an offer letter. (I\nbelieve I’ve received an offer letter at only two companies during my career.)\nSince many designers end up landing at small agencies, there is a good chance\nthat you will be extended a verbal offer at some point in your career. Don’t\nlet your soon-to-be employer get away with it. Either ask them to send you a\nletter or email that details the offer, or do it for them.\n\n_Dear John,_\n\n_Thanks for the job offer. I am excited to begin working with you. Just so\nthat we have something in writing, here are the details we discussed: starting\nsalary will be $XX,XXX and the benefits will begin on XX/XX/XXXX. Can’t wait\nto start working together!_\n\n_Sally_\n\nDoing work without documentation is like getting in the fast lane on the way\nto the poor house. Quick emails like these can be a lifesaver as you review\nproject scope and billing with your clients, or take on a new position with an\nemployer.\n\n\n## 103\\. Next Worry Date\n\nNo surprise: 2009 was a challenging economic year. I was asked by a designer\nfriend whose own business failed, “What do you attribute your survival to?”\nImmediately I thought of the standard things: good customer service, zero\ndebt, hard work, stress, tears, sweat, hope, luck, faith...we exercised them\nall during that challenging time. However, one of the things that didn’t\nimmediately come to mind, but likely had just as big an impact, was tracking\nour numbers and reacting to the “Next Worry Date.”\n\nI’ve always been neurotic about my finances. Heck, I’m neurotic about a lot of\nthings. Every day our office manager posts our financial data on a secure site\nfor me to review. The data includes typical things such as\n\n• How much money is in each account?\n\n• How much money are we billing in each of the next three months?\n\n• How much money will we need to meet our expenses in each of the next three\nmonths?\n\n• How much money are we waiting to collect (receivables)?\n\nWatching hundreds of thousands of dollars come in and go out of our bank\naccounts every single month is very stressful. These numbers, along with a few\nothers, provide me with ammunition to help control that stress.\n\nA few years ago I realized that I was making calculations in my head based on\nthe numbers in an attempt to figure out if I should be worrying about money.\nThen it hit me! Why not figure out the calculation I was making and track the\nexact next date that I should be worrying about? Here is the **Next Worry Date\nFormula** :\n\n**(Starting Balance)**\n\n_Total cash in the bank_\n\n**+** _Total receivables_\n\n**+** _Total remaining billings for the current month_\n\n**+** _Total remaining billings for next month_\n\n**-** _Tax money (the money we have set aside to pay our quarterly taxes)_\n\n**-** _Emergency fund (the money we have set aside for absolute emergencies)_\n\n**=** _Total Cash Flow_\n\n**÷** _Monthly overhead cost_\n\n**=** _Number of months of cash flow coverage_\n\n**-** _One month_\n\n**=** _Next Worry Date (that is, one month before money runs out)_\n\nHere is the **Next Worry Date Formula Example (for a Freelancer)** in\naction—how the numbers may look if you are a freelancer working out of a home\noffice on, say, August 1st:\n\n**$12,300**\n\n_Total cash in the bank_\n\n**\\+ $6,400**\n\n_Total receivables_\n\n**\\+ $5,200**\n\n_Total remaining billings for the current month_\n\n**\\+ $3,500**\n\n_Total remaining billings for next month_\n\n**\\- $3,000**\n\n_Tax money—since it is August 1st, you have two $1,500 quarterly tax payments\nremaining for the year_\n\n**\\- $1,500**\n\n_Emergency fund_\n\n**= $14,400**\n\n_Total Cash Flow_\n\n**÷ $6,000**\n\n_Monthly overhead cost—let’s say you pay yourself $5,000 per month and have\n$1,000 in additional business expenses_\n\n**= 2.4 months**  \n**\\- One month**\n\n_Number of months of cash flow coverage_\n\n**= 1.4 months**\n\n_Next Worry Date is one month before money runs out_\n\n**= September 30th**\n\n_Next Worry Date_\n\n![Image](../images/00132.jpeg)\n\nSince it is August 1st, your Next Worry Date is approximately September 30th.\nYou’ll notice that the next worry date is one month before money runs out.\nYou’ll also notice that your emergency fund is not included in that month of\ncash flow. You can’t wait until all of the money is gone before you make tough\ndecisions. The month of cash flow and the emergency fund buy you time if and\nwhen things inevitably go south at some point in your career as a designer.\n\nThis next case is what your **Next Worry Date Formula Example (for a Small\nDesign Agency)** might look like if you are a small design agency of ten\npeople or so. We’ll keep the current date as August 1st for the sake of\nsimplicity:\n\n**$87,300**\n\n_Total cash in the bank_\n\n**\\+ $109,000**\n\n_Total receivables_\n\n**\\+ $72,500**\n\n_Total remaining billings for the current month_\n\n**\\+ $58,400**\n\n_Total remaining billings for next month_\n\n**\\- $12,000**\n\n_Tax money—since it is August 1st, you have two $6,000 quarterly tax payments\nremaining for the year_\n\n**\\- $45,000**\n\n_Emergency fund_\n\n**= $270,200**\n\n_Total Cash Flow_\n\n**÷ $65,000**\n\n_Monthly overhead cost_\n\n**= 4.16 months**  \n**\\- One month**\n\n_Number of months of cash flow coverage_\n\n**= 3.16 months**\n\n_Next Worry Date is one month before money runs out_\n\n**= October 31st**\n\n_Next Worry Date_\n\nSo, what do you do if on the Next Worry Date you actually have no money as\nprojected? REACT! You have two choices: Either green light some projects or\ncut costs today! You cannot wait any longer. It takes a little time for\nfinancial decisions to unravel, so if you ever hit the Next Worry Date\ncashless, make immediate decisions. Then continue a constant assessment of\nwhere you are financially to keep yourself aware of where things are. This\nwill allow you to tackle each day with confidence and purpose rather than\nworking in a vacuum.\n\n\n## 104\\. Nickels and Dimes Are for Lemonade Stands\n\nSince the formation of our company, we have sent only two change orders. In an\nindustry riddled with scope creep, this is an unprecedented statistic.\nAdmittedly, this strategy has caused us to lose money on a few projects.\nHowever, the quantity of referrals and repeating customers that have flooded\nour agency as a result of our flexibility has more than made up for these\nsmall losses. Nobody likes to be nickel-and-dimed, especially when they are\nspending large sums of money.\n\nA few years ago we tried out a new accountant during tax season. Things seemed\nto be going well. They completed our taxes and were wrapping everything up\nsmoothly. Our representative at the accounting firm called me and told me that\neverything was finished and ready for submission; he offered to bring the\ndocuments to my office so that I could sign everything and they could ship\nthem off. I was grateful for this offer and looked forward to getting our\ntaxes wrapped up.\n\n![Image](../images/00133.jpeg)\n\nAbout a week later we received the invoice from our new accounting firm. Not\nonly was the bill for the tax work twice as much as they had quoted me, but\nthey had included a $25 mileage fee for bringing me the tax documents! I was\nshocked that they had charged me for something that seemed to be part of what\nI would consider good customer service. Call me crazy, but a $25 mileage\ncharge has no business showing up on a $3,500 invoice. Suffice it to say, we\ndropped the accounting firm like it was a cherry bomb on the 4th of July.\n\nYour clients will drop you, as well, if they feel like you are nickel-and-\ndiming them. There is no question about that. The trick is to price things\nright in the first place. Make sure there is a little bit of padding in your\nproposed project cost. Then, when a client asks for an extra tweak here and\nthere, you can accommodate them without feeling like you are losing money. It\nis also advised that you know where you stand financially on each project.\nTrack your costs so that you can go the extra mile when the budget allows,\nwithout having to bombard your client with change orders.\n\n\n## 105\\. Only Terrorists Like Hostage Situations\n\nWe had just green lit a project to create an iPhone application for a major\nHollywood studio. We were excited about it, as it was our first iPhone app.\nThe only problem was we didn’t have any Objective-C programmers on staff.\nFortunately for us, we had a great relationship with an agency that\nspecialized in app development. We called and they were more than happy to\nhelp us with this cool project. We got a price from them for the pieces we\nneeded assistance with, and they got started.\n\nA few days later, the milestone arrived for designs to be sent to the client.\nOur outsourced agency said they had the comps ready, but they wouldn’t deliver\nthem to us until we paid the first invoice—an invoice they hadn’t even sent us\nyet! To them we said, “Fine, send us the invoice and we’ll pay it so we can\nget the designs from you and stay on schedule.” Inside our offices we said,\n“Do they think we’re a bunch of criminals? It’s like they are holding the\ndesigns hostage until we pay the ransom! We’re a successful agency a couple\nmiles down the road from them. Of course we’re going to pay!” This experience\nput a blemish on our relationship and made us feel as if our vender did not\ntrust us.\n\nAs a designer you have to take a leap of faith when you start many projects.\nBut trust is a two-way street. You get started working on the designs,\ntrusting that the client will pay. If you force the client to pay you first,\nthen they have to trust that they are going to be satisfied with your work.\nWhen our vendor made us pay their ransom, we became the only party in the\nrelationship taking a risk.\n\nAt our agency, we typically invoice a portion of the project at the start of\nproduction (25 to 50 percent depending on the size of the project). We get\nstarted on the work trusting that the client will pay the invoice. There have\nbeen times when we’ve had to halt production after an unusual delay in\npayment. There have also been a few times when a client never paid the initial\ninvoice and we’ve been out our cost to that point of the project.\n\nMake a careful assessment of a new client. If you get a feeling that they may\nnot be trustworthy, then you are absolutely justified in holding work for\nransom—or even waiting to begin the project until after you receive initial\npayment. Just know that sometimes a client with good intentions will be\noffended by your lack of trust in them.\n\nIf you do trust your client, don’t tarnish your relationship with them by\nholding your work hostage until the ransom is paid. If you don’t trust your\nclient, then maybe you should take a close look at whether you should be\nworking with them in the first place.\n\n![Image](../images/00134.jpeg)\n\n\n## 106\\. Oh Where, Oh Where Has My $100K Gone? Oh Where, Oh Where Can It Be?\n\nAbout two years into my career, I was hired by a direct marketing agency. It\nwas the mid-nineties, and I was the small company’s only “web guy.” There\nweren’t many “web guys” in existence at the time. The company was affiliated\nwith a private school conglomerate, and many of the projects we did were for\nthose institutions.\n\n![Image](../images/00135.jpeg)\n\nI single-handedly project managed, designed, and programmed many of the\nwebsites the agency landed. I operated as what I thought to be a one-man show.\nOn one occasion, I found out that the agency was charging the client $22,000\nfor the website I was creating. The project lasted about four weeks and at the\ntime I was making $28,000 per year. After the project successfully completed,\nI thought, “Man! This company is making so much money off of me! I deserve a\nraise! I made them $22,000 in four weeks! That almost covers what they are\npaying me for an entire year!”\n\nWhat I have learned after years of running my own business is that it totally\ndoesn’t work that way, as much as I wish it did. It just doesn’t. When this\ncompany billed our client $22,000 and I subtracted my four-week cost to do the\nwork, $2,153.84, it did not leave $19,846.16, even though at the time I\nthought it did. And that sentiment caused me to waste my energy in frustration\nfor what I was being paid.\n\nA business has many costs that are not known by the employees. When I first\nstarted hiring other designers to help me with my abundant freelance work, I\noften felt overwhelmed by the flow of money in and the flow of money out. Over\nthe years, this constant flow of money has helped me to gain a better\nunderstanding of why the $22,000 website I built was not quite as profitable\nas I once thought.\n\nHere are a few scenarios based on past phases of my small design agency to\nhelp illustrate where all the money goes. Before we get into that, let me take\na moment to define each of the expense categories. I’ve grouped many of the\nindividual elements into bigger categories to help us digest the information\nmore easily.\n\n**Expenses**\n\n**Project:** This category reflects things like stock photos, website hosting,\nand other elements necessary to complete a project for a client.\n\n**General:** Includes office supplies, networking group dues, subscriptions,\nclient gifts, postage and delivery, and other miscellaneous costs that occur\neach month.\n\n**Insurance:** Includes the company’s costs for health, dental, liability, and\nerrors and omissions insurance (required by some of our higher profile\nclients).\n\n**Occupancy:** This category is for all costs relating to office space,\nincluding lease payment, building association fees for common areas, security\nsystem, janitorial, telephone, Internet connection, and other types of\nutilities.\n\n**Payroll:** Payroll is the most significant cost for most graphic design\ntypes of businesses. In these scenarios, this category reflects the wages\ntaken home by the employees.\n\n**Payroll Taxes and Processing:** The employer is required to pay a matching\namount of your social security and Medicare taxes as well as state and federal\nunemployment tax. This category also includes the costs to an accountant or\npayroll company for processing payroll checks and taking care of the state and\nfederal tax payments.\n\n![Image](../images/00136.jpeg)\n\n**Freelancer:** It seems we are always using freelancers for some aspects of\nour businesses. This category represents those fluctuating costs.\n\n**Travel:** Most of our clients are out of state, which requires travel. For\nour business development efforts to be successful, we find ourselves making\nthe rounds with out-of-state clients about every other month.\n\n**Marketing and Advertising:** Magazine ads, direct mail, billboards, or\nwhatever works for your business would be applied to this category.\n\n**Monthly Expenses Scenario 1**\n\n**(Six-person design agency in a 2,000-square-foot office space.)**\n\nProject = $3,500\n\nGeneral = $1,500\n\nInsurance = $3,500\n\nOccupancy = $5,750\n\nPayroll = $19,750\n\nPayroll Taxes and Processing = $4,500\n\nFreelancer = $2,500\n\nTravel = $2,750\n\nMarketing and Advertising = $750\n\nTotal = $44,500\n\n**Monthly Expenses Scenario 2**\n\n**(Ten-person design agency in 2,000-square-foot office space.)**\n\nProject = $2,750\n\nGeneral = $2,750\n\nInsurance = $4,500\n\nOccupancy = $5,750\n\nPayroll = $34,000\n\nPayroll Taxes and Processing = $8,750\n\nFreelancer = $3,000\n\nTravel = $1,500\n\nMarketing and Advertising = $2,000\n\nTotal = $65,000\n\n**Monthly Expenses Scenario 3**\n\n**(Fifteen-person design agency in 3,000-square-foot office space.)**\n\nProject = $5,500\n\nGeneral = $3,250\n\nInsurance = $6,500\n\nOccupancy = $6,750\n\nPayroll = $51,750\n\nPayroll Taxes and Processing = $18,000\n\nFreelancer = $4,500\n\nTravel = $2,250\n\nMarketing and Advertising = $2,500\n\nTotal = $101,000\n\nThe above scenarios are accurate costs (with a little rounding of the numbers\nfor easier math) of various stages of growth in my business. So, what do you\ndo with the profits?\n\nThe first thing to understand about profits is taxes. Everyone is lumped into\na tax bracket based on their income. If you have small profits, you have a\nsmall tax bracket. If you have a lot of profits, then your tax bracket is\nbigger. Tax brackets range from 10 percent to 39 percent of your income. For a\nbusiness, everything you bill above your expenses is taxed. For the sake of\nthese scenarios, let’s say the business is taxed at 30 percent. A business\npays these taxes on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe second thing to understand about profits is “nest eggs.” In order to\nsurvive, a company must have some cash reserves. Several different people have\nrecommended that a company like mine should have three- to six-month’s worth\nof cash reserves in the bank. That means if we are costing $101,000 per month\n(like Scenario 3), we should have somewhere between $303,000 to $606,000 in\nthe bank. The nest-egg money enables a business to ride out things such as\nlate payments (one of our Fortune 10 clients pays in 120 days, regardless of\nwhat you request on your invoice), getting stiffed (someday, someone is going\nto cheat you and not pay for the work you did), and economic turmoil (my\ncompany would have died during the 2009 recession if we didn’t have a solid\nnest egg to help us ride through the tough times).\n\n![Image](../images/00137.jpeg)\n\nEach month, from our profits we take out 30 percent for taxes and 50 percent\nto add to our nest egg. That leaves 20 percent to play with. In the past, the\n20 percent left goes toward things like computer and software upgrades, office\nupgrades, hiring new talent to help grow the business, employee parties,\nemployee gifts, and bonuses.\n\nLet’s take a look at Scenario 1 again, and this time, we’ll look at how the\nprofits play out.\n\n* * *\n\nAS A BUSINESS OWNER,\n\nNOTHING HELPS\n\nYOU SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT\n\nTHAN HAVING\n\nMONEY IN THE BANK.\n\nNOTHING.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Scenario 1, we had a monthly expense of $44,500. Let’s say the company\nbilled $60,000 that month. “Wow,” you might think, “Let’s divide up that\nremaining $15,500!” Great idea! But first, let’s set aside 30 percent for\ntaxes ($4,650) and 50 percent to add to the company nest egg ($7,750). Take\nthose amounts out of the $15,500 and you have only $3,100 of profits left to\nplay with. Even if you structured your company to split that profit evenly\nbetween all six people, you’d take home only about $516 each. Nobody is\ngetting rich off of that. So that job I had as the “web guy” those many years\nago sort of fit into a scenario such as this one.\n\nNow you might be thinking, “How does anyone get rich owning a business?” Good\nquestion. I billed tons of money for years and didn’t feel like I had much to\nshow for it. I was keeping tons of money in my business’ nest egg based on the\nparanoia that we would need it to keep the company running off of that nest\negg at some point in the future. Then the magic day happened. I looked at the\nbank accounts and we had a sizable nest egg in place. I had amassed several\nmonths’ worth of lifesaving money and it was all sitting in my business\naccounts. We had plenty of work and plenty of money. I set aside the 30\npercent of profit each month for taxes and every penny that was left became\n“extra profit.” Those were fun days in our business. We had a sizable nest\negg. We had tons of work. And the “extra money” was now piling up. We had lots\nof bonuses, raises, and employee perks. And I was able to take home lots of\nmoney on top of all that. Getting “rich” in business happens. It just takes\ntime to put the money in the right places before the “extra money” becomes\navailable.\n\nI have had several bankers and accountants dig into my company’s financials\nand applaud this financial strategy. They often cite examples of other\nbusiness owners spending their profits each month on cars, trucks, and other\nexpensive toys while not considering the need for a rainy day, nest egg, or\nfuture tax implications. To me, these considerations just makes sense.\n\nMy father-in-law used to say, “Spend a little, save a little.” Too many people\nforget the second part of that phrase and operate in a “Spend a lot, save\nnothing” lifestyle. As a business owner, nothing helps you sleep better at\nnight than having money in the bank. Nothing.\n\n\n## 107\\. Don’t Do Anything You Can Pay Someone $10 Per Hour to Do\n\nI was massively burned out at the end of a three-year stretch of freelance\nslavery. I had so much client work piled on me I couldn’t see straight enough\nto try to figure out how to hire someone to help. I spent every day from early\nin the morning until late at night with my head down, just trying to get it\nall done. From time to time, I would leave my cave to attend a networking\ngroup of some kind. On one occasion, I sat with a small group of four business\nowners. We were chatting over the challenges we face in our businesses, and\nwhen it came to be my turn I didn’t have to dig deep to know what my struggle\nwas. I told them, “I’m buried in work. I’m stressed out of my mind. I don’t\nknow how I’m going to get everything done. And, by the way, I have to leave in\nthree minutes and forty-seven seconds. I just have way too much to do.” One of\nthe business owners shared this life-changing advice, “Don’t do anything you\ncan pay someone $10 per hour to do.”\n\n![Image](../images/00138.jpeg)\n\nGenius! Why hadn’t I thought of it before? Well actually, I had. I was just\nthinking about it the wrong way. I made the calculation this way: a $10 per\nhour employee will cost me roughly $25,000 per year. Even though I had plenty\nof money saved up, I was nervous about the $25,000 commitment.\n\nWhat I should have been thinking was: A $10-per-hour employee will cost me\n$200 per week if I start them out at 20 hours per week. I was spending 80\nhours a week working. And I was billing $5,000 to $6,000 per week. Even if the\n$10-per-week, 20-hours-per-week employee is half as productive as I am, they\nwill save me 10 hours per week. Which means I’ll be working 70 hours per week\nand still be able to net $4,800 to $5,800 per week. And if it doesn’t seem to\nbe working out, I can always let them go after a few weeks. So, my real\nfinancial risk is about $800 to test out this concept for a month. It is NOT\nthe $25,000 commitment I had assumed it to be.\n\nI made a list of all the things I had to do each week and then separated out\nthe ones that a $10-per-hour employee could handle:\n\n• Answer the phones\n\n• Pay bills\n\n• Go through the mail\n\n• Package up client deliveries\n\n• Make requested client changes\n\n• Test website projects\n\n• Proof print projects\n\n• Run errands\n\n• File paperwork\n\n• Send invoices\n\n• Follow up on late payments\n\n• Make bank deposits\n\n• Balance the checkbook\n\n• Order equipment\n\n• Update spreadsheets\n\n• Gather client assets\n\n• Backup files\n\n• Write blog posts\n\n• Manage social media\n\nAfter I finished the list, I realized that I was spending a lot more than 20\nhours per week doing all these things at the ultimate expense of the design\nand programming work that I actually could bill for. I decided to go for it.\nAs I’ve said before, my wife found my first employee and my mother-in-law\nfound my second employee. I was amazed at how much help these first couple\nemployees were. The problem was that these employees were freeing up my time,\nand that freed-up time was now being filled with new clients and projects that\nI could bill for. The next logical step was to hire more people, which was an\neasier decision this time around. By the end of that year, I employed six\npeople and had moved to office space down the road from my home.\n\nAt some point, as a successful full-time freelancer, you have to take the\nplunge and hire someone. Make your own list of things you are doing that can\nbe done by a lower-cost employee. Your goal should be to do only the things\nyou can do, and delegate the rest. Not every employee is going to work out.\nLook at each new hire through the lens of a simple one-month commitment. Make\nsure you have enough money set aside to pay them for that one month; if it\nworks out, you’ll likely fall in love with them during that month and a long-\nterm commitment to them will become obvious. If it doesn’t work out, don’t be\nafraid to cut them loose and try again.\n\n\n## 108\\. “Skin in the Game” Usually Means “Free”\n\nEvery year we have several people come into our office with an “idea” that\nthey want us to build. Usually these ideas revolve around being something like\n“the next Facebook” or “the next Club Penguin.” Of course, these people\nusually have no money and want us to build it in trade for “skin in the game”\n(that is, a percent ownership in the new business or product). So far, in my\nown graphic design business, I have yet to agree to build anyone’s idea in\ntrade for skin in the game. I also have yet to see any one of these ideas that\nwere pitched to us actually get built (meaning that these same idea people\nwere unsuccessful in getting anyone else to build for them). I’m not saying\nthat you should never pull the trigger on building someone’s idea in trade for\nequity; I suggest only that you consider a few things prior to accepting a\n“skin in the game” deal.\n\n**Got any documentation?**\n\nIt is a bit humorous to me that most of the people pitching their “idea” to us\ndon’t have any documentation in place. There is no business plan, no request\nfor proposal, no strategy document—nothing. This is a big red flag and means\nyou are either getting in at the very ground level, or, more likely, the idea\nperson has no real clue what they are doing, and you should expect to have to\ncreate the whole strategy and execution yourself.\n\nIn this case, you should hold out for a larger percentage of the company if\nyou agree to build the product in trade for ownership. It is like someone\nsaying, “I have an idea. We should build a rocket ship that flies to the moon,\nand I’ll give you 10 percent if you build it.” Sure, flying to the moon is a\nfun idea. But the idea alone is not worth 90 percent of the ownership since\nthere is SO MUCH work involved in its execution. Be sure to make an accurate\nassessment of the workload and hold out for an appropriate percentage of\nownership.\n\n**“Skin in the game” usually means “free”**\n\nThe stars have to align for something like Facebook to take off the way it\ndid. Do your due diligence. If you are convinced that this person’s idea is\ngoing to take off and be HUGE, then go for it. But in most cases, there will\nlikely be no return on your investment. In fact, I recommend that you plan on\nzero return. If the idea is so amazing and exciting that you still want to\nwork on it even if you get nothing in return, then go for it. In certain\ncircumstances, I think it is valid to consider building out someone’s idea for\npotentially zero return.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\nIf the project will be a shining star in your portfolio, it may be worth\nconsidering doing it for free. Certain portfolio projects can help you land\nnew work or even break into new industries.\n\n**Charity**\n\nIf the project is for a good cause, it may be worth considering. There is\ndefinitely intrinsic value in doing charitable work.\n\n**Relationship**\n\nIf the relationships you build by doing the project have potential value, then\nit may be worth considering a partnership. Perhaps you feel strongly that\nthese relationships will lead to new and exciting opportunities. In the end,\nyou have to assume you will get no monetary return on your investment, and if\nyou’re OK with that, then go for it.\n\n**Define roles**\n\nIf you decide to partner with someone to build an idea, be sure to clearly\ndefine the roles. In a good partnership, those roles will be easy to identify.\nYou, as a graphic designer or programmer, will likely be handling the\nproduction aspects. This means that your partners should be overseeing the\nbusiness and marketing elements. Be sure to clearly define and document these\nroles prior to engaging in the partnership. If there is too much overlap, then\nyou are probably headed for some frustrating power struggles.\n\n**It will always be “their idea”**\n\nMost people pitching you an idea are looking for a way to get their idea built\nfor free. They are not necessarily looking for a partner in the truest sense\nof the word. They just don’t have any money or aren’t willing to spend their\nown cash on the idea. You must understand this prior to engaging in the\npartnership. After all is said and done, from their point of view, the idea\nwill always be their idea and you are just a pawn in the game. If you are OK\nwith this and still want to build the product, then go for it.\n\n**A better structure**\n\nSpending internal resources costs you money. Whether you are a freelancer, a\nsmall team, or a large agency, every hour spent by someone in your company\ncosts you money. You should know what that cost is (divide your total annual\noverhead by the number of man-hours available, and that is your hourly burn\nrate). So, let’s say your overhead cost is $50 per hour. And you have a two-\nway partnership with someone to build a product. If it is an equal split, then\neach partner should put in $25 for every hour spent. Track all the hours and\nsettle up at the end of each month. If the idea person is interested only in\nyou paying for all the development costs but they want to retain most of the\nownership in the product, watch out...stormy waters could be ahead for you.\n\n**You get what you pay for**\n\nThis old cliché holds true in most circumstances. If you engage in an unpaid\nproject, it will probably become a pain for you when paying work piles up. In\nmost cases, the unpaid project will take a backseat to the paying work, and\nyour “partner” will grow frustrated with you as you lag in the development of\n“their rocket ship to the moon.”\n\n**Your best chance of success is staying focused**\n\nIn some years, we have managed to enjoy a 40- to 50-percent profit margin at\nour agency. Every time we are pitched an idea, we have to weigh it against the\npotential profits in our core business. Usually, a small ownership in an idea\nthat takes us off focus of our core business doesn’t make sense. Our agency is\nalready making money. Instead of spending our time and energy going off in\nanother direction to build someone’s idea project, we are usually better off\nspending our time and energy figuring out ways to generate more work for our\nagency and enjoying a healthy profit margin. Your potential is likely the\nsame.\n\n![Image](../images/00139.jpeg)\n\n\n## 109\\. Three-Month “Lifetime” Guarantee\n\nI come from a family where I watched my father work for the same company for\nmore than two decades. Naturally, I expected upon graduating from college that\nI would find a job and stay there for a while. I loved the idea of improving\nmy skills over time and growing inside of a company.\n\nI quickly learned that job security and a graphic designer’s life don’t\nexactly go hand in hand—this realized after I outgrew my first job in about\nfive months and my second job in six months. My third job lasted about a year,\nand as I was leaving, the management team was busy running the company into\nthe ground. The job after that lasted almost two years before the company\nbecame so financially upside down that I was given my computer in lieu of my\nlast paycheck.\n\nFinally I landed at Fox! I had a creative director title, a six-figure salary,\nand a window office, and I worked for a multibillion-dollar company. During my\nfirst week, I remember thinking, “Yay! Finally I landed somewhere stable. I am\ngoing to work here for the next ten years or more!” Little did I know that the\nFox groups I worked for—Fox Family and Fox Kids—would be sold to Disney six\nmonths later, and I would spend the next year and a half watching the company\nbe dismantled as it was absorbed into the Disney organization.\n\nWhen I ventured off into the world of freelancing, I continued to learn that a\ndesigner’s future is almost always a cloudy one. My first year started out\nstrong, and then I hit a time in December when I had absolutely no work. I\npanicked for a few weeks and began polishing up my résumé just in time for\nthings to start picking back up about a month later, followed by a few more\nyears of successful freelancing.\n\nLater, as my agency grew, I hoped that perhaps I could expect a little more\nstability. I had saved up hundreds of thousands of dollars and was in a better\nposition to weather the storms of a graphic designer’s life. But then the\nrecession hit in 2008 and I watched several hundred thousand of my net worth\ndisappear in a few short months as I subsidized upside-down months and saw\nassets depreciate.\n\nThank you for indulging my trip down memory lane. If you’ve been working as a\ngraphic designer for a few years, your story is likely filled with your own\ntales of loss and insecurity. What I have learned is that life as a graphic\ndesigner really has only about a three-month guarantee. This is because most\ndesign-related businesses have about three months’ worth of guaranteed future.\nThey know what projects they are working on. They have a pretty good idea of\nwhat corporate decisions are being made. Consequently, it is safe to assume\nthat your job is safe for at least three months. Beyond that, who knows?\n\nEconomic volatility, fluctuations in client spending, mergers and\nacquisitions, and corporate restructuring can spell an end to your cushy\ndesign job. Enjoy the job while you have it.\n\nWhile running my design business over the past several years, I have seen the\nthree-month rule apply in a few different ways. When I first began hiring\npeople, I worried about increasing my annual overhead with each salary. I lost\nsleep at night worrying about how I would be able to pay my new junior\ndesigner $30,000 over the course of the year. What I should have been thinking\nis that I needed to make sure I could afford to pay that employee $7,500 over\nthe next three months (at the time, this was a fraction of the money I already\nhad in the bank). I have since learned, through experience, that the second\nand third sets of three-month hurdles always seem to take care of themselves,\nor at least, there is no sense in worrying about them before the fact.\n\n![Image](../images/00140.jpeg)\n\nWith the cash-flow fluctuations at our agency, we have also learned not to\nhire on a spike and fire on a dip. What I mean is that hiring a new employee\nduring a busy month may mean letting them go when the following month isn’t as\nbusy. But if you ride out a batch of three busy months and the future looks\nbright, that is the time to consider adding some heads to the team. And if you\nare a freelancer or small-agency owner, brace yourself financially for up to\nthree lulling months before you begin to decide whether it is time to let\npeople go or throw in the towel (see the chapter “[Next Worry\nDate](part0114.html#ch103),” earlier in this section, for examples of planning\nfor hard times).\n\nAll of this being said, I have employees who have worked for my agency for\nmore than six years. There are certainly exceptions to every rule. My point is\nthat by choosing to be a graphic designer, you’ll likely have to learn to live\nwith some occupational volatility. It seems to be part of the package.\n\n* * *\n\nBY CHOOSING TO BE\n\nA GRAPHIC DESIGNER,\n\nYOU’LL LIKELY HAVE TO\n\nLEARN TO LIVE WITH SOME\n\nOCCUPATIONAL VOLATILITY.\n\nIT SEEMS TO BE PART\n\nOF THE PACKAGE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 110\\. “Being Your Own Boss,” Whatever That Means\n\nWhoever coined the phrase “be your own boss” probably never was one. As a\nfreelancer or business owner, you certainly don’t have to ask permission to\ntake a lunch. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that “you are your own\nboss.” In fact, as an owner of a successful graphic design business, not only\nam I not really my own boss, I have about 30 bosses! Every active client we\nhave determines my professional future. Each of these bosses has the right to\ndemand things from me and my team. Sure, you can say “no” to your clients—you\ncan say “no” to your employer, too. But if you say “no” to your clients or\nyour employer too often, they will certainly go looking for someone else who\nwill say “yes.”\n\n![Image](../images/00141.jpeg)\n\nAdditionally, as a freelancer or business owner you get the privilege of “job\nhunting” nearly every week, as opposed to every few years like a normally\nemployed person. All potential projects require a résumé (we format them as a\nproposal for work), a salary requirement (we just refer to them as a cost\nestimate), and an interview (also known as a sales pitch).\n\nIf you are employed at a small graphic design business, you must understand\nthat everyone (including the business owner) is on the same team: a team\ndedicated to satisfying the needs of all the “bosses” and landing as many\n“jobs” as possible. The only real difference is the roles people play in the\ncompany. The business owner is typically the one trafficking the money, but\neveryone in the company is at the mercy of the clients and the ebb and flow of\nwork.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; the benefits of freelancing or owning a business can make\nit well worth it. Just prepare yourself for a lot of bosses and a lot of job\nhunting.\n\n\n## 111\\. How to Bite the Bullet\n\nI’ve been asked several times in my career, “I’m starting to feel like I want\nto quit my job and try freelancing full-time. How do you know when it is time\nto bite the bullet and do it?”\n\nWhen I started my freelance career, I didn’t have any other options. During\n2002 when I bit the bullet, the economy was still struggling to pull out of\nthe dot bomb and post-9/11 woes. Our group at Fox had been sold to Disney, and\nhundreds of people were laid off in the transition, including myself.\nFreelancing was my only real choice, and fortunately I had a couple key\nrelationships with individuals in decision-making positions who were feeding\nme enough work to get by.\n\n![Image](../images/00142.jpeg)\n\nThroughout the past several years, I have grown to see how fortunate I was to\nnot “go the way of the dodo bird” like so many freelancers do as work dries\nup. Thankfully, I had a few things in place that helped me survive. Here is\nsome advice to help you know if the time is right for you to bite the bullet.\nThe right combination of these elements can ensure your survival as a\nfreelancer and perhaps help you grow a successful agency of your own.\n\n**Money in the Bank:** Nothing will help you sleep better than having money in\nthe bank. When I started out I had managed to save about $60,000. At the time\nI felt like it was barely enough, but in hindsight I realize that it was\nplenty. I had no overhead other than paying for my family’s living expenses.\n\nLack of cash kills most freelancers. You have to have money to be able to ride\nout delays in payment and the occasionally client who doesn’t pay at all. One\nof our biggest entertainment industry clients pays their bills in 120 days.\nThat’s four months after we invoice them! We can invoice them net 30 and it\nmakes no difference. They pay according to their accounting standards and we\ncan’t do anything about it. I suppose we could not do work for them. But this\nis definitely the type of client you want to do work for: They supply us with\nhigh-profile and high-dollar projects. We have always made sure we have money\nin the bank to afford us the choice to endure their drawn-out accounting\nstandards.\n\nThree- to six-month’s worth of money is usually a good minimum amount to have\non hand. Figure out your business and personal monthly cost of living.\nMultiply that amount by three or six months, and start saving. On top of the\nthree- to six-month’s worth of cash in the bank, it is advised to have some\nopen lines of credit in place for a rainy day. At the start you may just want\nto get a credit card or two. We opened a large business line of credit with\nour bank several years ago. Keep the balance at zero and view these credit\nlines as “emergency only” options. Thankfully, we’ve never had to dip into\nours to keep our business afloat. If you ever get to where you are running\nyour freelance business on credit, it might be time to consider finding a\nfull-time job.\n\n**A Sugar Daddy:** Having a contract, retainer, or long-term project with a\nclient can be all the ammunition you need to feel secure venturing out on your\nown. An agency down the road from us has had a long-term contract with a large\ntech company in our area. This contract has employed over half their staff for\nseveral years, and provided them with the cash flow necessary to grow and\nexpand their agency in other areas.\n\nAt my agency, our biggest annual client changed four times in our first eight-\nyears, however in the early years of my freelance career I had an\nentertainment industry client who didn’t have an internal production team.\nThey outsourced all of their digital media needs to me and provided me with\n“sugar daddy” cash flow.\n\n**Contacts:** You cannot know too many people. If you are thinking of\nfreelancing full-time, take a close look at your pool of contacts. Leverage\nthe law of averages. The more people you know, the more people will know you\nare freelancing, and the more people will give you work. Get involved in\nnetworking groups, and don’t be bashful in letting people know you are looking\nfor new projects.\n\n![Image](../images/00143.jpeg)\n\nBe social online. Connect with everyone you know on both business and personal\nsocial media sites. Provide status updates on these sites to help raise\nawareness of what you are doing.\n\n**A Marketing Plan:** Figure out how you are going to market your services.\nWill you advertise in magazines? Online? Through direct mail? Relationship-\nmarketing only? Your marketing plan will be unique to your specific expertise,\nservice offering, and geographic location. Regardless of your situation, you\nwill want to set some money aside to begin the arduous task of experimenting\nwith different strategies until you find what works for you.\n\n**Fallback Options:** I have a great relationship with every boss I’ve ever\nhad. Unfortunately, for some of my ex-employees that is not the case. I’ve\nbeen shocked a few times as some of my employees have not just burned the\nbridge on their way out the door, but more accurately detonated a nuclear\nmissile on the bridge. You never know when you are going to need past\nrelationships. You may even need to put your tail between your legs and ask to\nget your job back if things don’t pan out with your freelancing aspirations.\n\n![Image](../images/00144.jpeg)\n\nWhen you leave your current employer to start your freelance career, be sure\nto keep your relationship with them intact. Don’t be afraid to have a candid\ndiscussion with them to let them know you feel it is time to try freelancing,\nand that if things don’t work out you hope they would consider bringing you\nback on. If you are an asset to their organization, they will more than likely\nbe grateful to have you back. We have had a few employees come back and work\nwith us multiple times. This is not uncommon in today’s business world.\n\n**Helping Hands:** Nobody is truly a “solo” freelancer. In order to succeed,\nyou need relationships with people who can be your helping hands. Begin now by\nbuilding relationships with people who will help you succeed. If you are a\ndesigner, you’ll likely need to know some programmers. If you are a\nprogrammer, you’ll need some designers. Figure out where your shortcomings are\nand find people who fill in the gaps for you.\n\n**Partner Companies:** Some of our most important relationships are with\nprinters and web-hosting companies. We can design cool print projects, but if\nthe printer does a bad job, then we look bad. The same goes with web hosting.\nThe coolest site design in the world is a total flop if the server goes down.\nBe sure to have a few trusted partners in place to ensure your projects\nachieve their full measure of success.\n\n**Mentor:** I wish that I had one when I started out—it surely would have\nhelped me avoid many struggles and hard lessons along the way. If you can find\nsomeone who you respect, who has been successful in the career track you are\nventuring into, and who is willing to answer an occasional question from you,\nthen you are one step ahead. Many successful people are happy to impart\nwisdom, but be sure to be respectful of their time. Success brings with it a\nmultitude of responsibilities, and their time may be very limited. I have been\nasked to act as a mentor for a couple up-and-coming design agency owners who\nhave one or two employees. Weekly calls and emails not only provide them with\nsupport, but they also help me to gain new insights on how to run my business\nby helping them work through their challenges.\n\n**Banker:** Talk with a banker and make sure you have all of your financial\naccounts set up in the best possible manner. Be sure to separate your business\naccounts from your personal accounts, as this will save you the possibility of\nan accounting issue down the road. Your bank can also help you put in place\npayroll once you start having some employees of your own.\n\n**Accountant:** I’ve changed accountants a few times during my career. Ask\nyour trusted contacts for referrals and find a good accountant or you’ll find\nyourself changing accountants, too. You’ll need an accountant to advise you on\nquarterly tax payments, as well as to work with you to file your annual tax\nreturns. A good accountant is a great resource to answer all your financial\nquestions. They can also help advise you and set up the legal structure of\nyour business. (Sole Proprietorship? LLC? Corporation?). Spending a little\nmoney on a consultation at the start of your freelance career is an excellent\ninvestment; getting things started correctly from the beginning can help save\nyou headaches later on.\n\n![Image](../images/00145.jpeg)\n\n**Insurance Agent:** It doesn’t cost much to get a little insurance. I\nsometimes joke that I “collect insurance.” Even a small business insurance\npolicy is something that every freelancer or business owner would be wise to\nhave in their start-up arsenal. If you start growing a company, your insurance\nagent can help with health insurance and other needs.\n\n**Financial Advisor:** Once you start finding some success, you’ll benefit\nfrom working with an experienced and knowledgeable financial advisor. These\ntrusted relationships can help you make smart financial decisions and put your\nhard-earned money into the right investment vehicles. Many financial advisory\nfirms also provide employee benefits services; as you grow, they can be a\ngreat resource to help you put in place retirement savings plans for you and\nyour employees.\n\n**Industry Relationships:** I love getting to know other people who are doing\nsimilar things to what I’m doing. I have had countless lunches with other\nagency owners and independent freelancers. I also have a group of business\nowners with whom I meet weekly. I consider it “alcoholics anonymous” for\nbusiness owners. In these lunches and meetings we provide support for each\nother, share best practices, and advise one another on business challenges we\nare facing. Start by inviting people to lunch who wear shoes similar to yours.\nYou’ll quickly find that you face the same challenges as many other people.\n\nYou don’t necessarily need all of these things to be in place in order to get\nstarted on your own, although as you progress you will likely find that all of\nthem will become important. Take a look at this list and, if you feel you have\nenough in place to bolster your courage to take the next step, it might be\ntime to take the plunge and start out on your own.\n\n![Image](../images/00146.jpeg)\n\n\n## Index\n\n3D modeling, [40](part0020.html#page_40)\n\n3D-store website, [6](part0009.html#page_6)–[8](part0009.html#page_8)\n\n3-month rule,

An identity \nhelps manage the perception  \nof a company and differentiates  \nit from its competitors. A smart \nsystem conveys respect for the \ncustomer and makes it easy to \nunderstand features and benefits. \nA new product design or a better \nenvironment can delight a \ncustomer and create loyalty. An \neffective identity encompasses \nsuch elements as a name that is \neasy to remember or a distinctive \npackage design for a product. \nMake it easy for the sales \nforce to sell\nWhether it is the CEO of a global \nconglomerate communicating a \nnew vision to the board, a first-\ntime entrepreneur pitching to \nventure capital firms, or a financial \nadvisor creating a need for \ninvestment products, everyone is \nselling. Nonprofits, whether \nfundraising or soliciting new \nvolunteers, are continually selling. \nStrategic brand identity works \nacross diverse audiences and \ncultures to build an awareness  \nand understanding of a company \nand its strengths. By making \nintelligence visible, effective \nidentity seeks to communicate  \na company’s unique value \nproposition. The coherence of \ncommunications across various \nmedia sends a strong signal to the \ncustomer about the laserlike focus \nof a company.\nMake it easy to build  \nbrand equity\nThe goal of all public companies is \nto increase shareholder value. A \nbrand, or a company’s reputation, \nis considered to be one of the \nmost valuable company assets. \nSmall companies and nonprofits \nalso need to build brand equity. \nTheir future success is dependent \non building public awareness, \npreserving their reputations, and \nupholding their value. A strong \nbrand identity will help build brand \nequity through increased \nrecognition, awareness, and \ncustomer loyalty, which in turn \nhelps make a company more \nsuccessful. Managers who seize \nevery opportunity to communicate \ntheir company’s brand value and \nwhat the brand stands for sleep \nbetter at night. They are building a \nprecious asset.\nAcknowledge that we live in a branded world.\nSeize every opportunity to position your company \nin your customers’ minds.\nCommunicate a strong brand idea over and  \nover again.\nGo beyond declaring a competitive advantage. \nDemonstrate it! \nUnderstand the customers. Build on their \nperceptions, preferences, dreams, values,  \nand lifestyles.\nIdentify touchpoints—places in which customers \ninterface with the product or service.\nUse brand identity to create sensory magnets to \nattract and retain customers. \n",

When a \nbrand innovates in China, it opens pathways for  \nglobal innovation. \nVladimir Djurovic\nPresident, Labbrand\nThe multinational companies that are most suc-\ncessful in China are the ones that don’t rush. \nThey begin by finding in-country native partners \nand advisors, taking the necessary time to build \nrelationships based on trust, respect, and under-\nstanding. Perhaps no branding activity reflects \nthe complexity of these cultures more than \nnaming—whether to blend and balance the East \nand West or to emphasize one over the other, \nand if so, which? What the name sounds like and \nmeans in which dialects further contributes to \nthe challenge of multilingual branding.\nAs brand builders rush into the emerging BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, \nIndia, and China), they most covet China, which represents the largest \nconsumer market in the world and a dynamic economy. However, from a \nbranding perspective, China is the most complex by far. Its vast diversity of \nregional, linguistic, and cultural nuances and its relative newness to \nbranding demand extensive research, native advisors, and local partners.\nWe are a fourth-generation \nwine producer and we are \nturning our attention to \nChina.\nMiguel A.

It is an ancient culture.\nMandarin and Cantonese are the main, but not the \nonly, Chinese dialects. \nChina’s trademark registration is competitive. \nBrands must be aware of the intellectual property \nregulations in China and incorporate this into their \nbrand development process.\nNaming\nChinese is a character-based language with \nessentially small picture icons conveying both \nmeaning and pronunciation. \nA Chinese name should reflect brand attributes, \nand does not need to be a direct translation of the \noriginal name. \nThe pronunciation and connotations of the \nChinese language vary greatly by region. Testing \nin the main Chinese dialects to avoid negative \nassociations is critical.\nCreating a local- or foreign-sounding Chinese \nname depends on the brand’s target consumer, \ncompetitors, cities, industry, and other \nmarketplace dynamics.\nSometimes Chinese names are chosen for the \nsimilarity of sound to the original brand name, but \nmore often for an associative and relevant \nmeaning.\nThe emphasis on auspiciousness, good fortune, \nhappiness, power, and status is important in \nChinese culture.\nIn 2011, trademark registration \napplications in China numbered \n1.41 million, a 32 percent \nincrease from the previous year \nand double the number in 2008.\nKleenex brand: Kimberly-Clark\nDecoding China’s cultural \ncodes is essential for \ncreating successful and \nmemorable brands. \nDenise Sabet\nVice GM\nLabbrand\nThe Chinese name for Kleenex \nmeans clean and comfort.\nEverwines is a wine retail chain in \nChina developed by Torres SA, a \nfourth-generation Spanish wine \nproducer. The final Chinese name \nchosen was \n (y\u001fong táo). \n \n(y\u001fong) means to sing or praise; it \nalso is pronounced the same as \n \n(y\u001fong, “forever”), thus corre-\nsponding to “Ever” in the English \nname. \n (táo) means grape, the \nsource of wine. \nEverwines: Labbrand\n",

Initially, \nprivate labeling was a business strategy aimed at \nhigher profit margins per product and increased \nrevenues. A private label product line is created \nand branded by a store, usually a large retail \nchain. The products themselves are produced by \na third-party supplier, which usually makes other \nname brand products for established national \nbrands. Companies like IKEA use the master \nbrand on all of their products, while companies \nlike Safeway and Aldi create multiple brands. \nSince it exists in branded environments, private label \ncan devote less energy to brand recognition, and more \nto great product stories.\nBruce Duckworth\nPrincipal, Turner Duckworth\nWe upped the quality, upped \nthe price, and we’re selling \nmore units.

Yet organizational devel-\nopment experts may tell you that decision by \nconsensus has the potential to result in higher-­\nquality decisions because the organization uses \nthe resources of its members.\nThe path to reconciling these seemingly con-\nflicting points of view leads to a brand champion \nor CEO with strong leadership skills—someone \nwho can elicit ideas and opinions from a wider \ngroup without succumbing to group-­think. In an \nideal situation, the final decision makers, regard-\nless of the size of the organization, should be \nkept to a very small group led by the CEO. The \ngroup makes informed choices that are aligned \nwith the vision of the organization, and is involved \nthroughout the process at key decision points, \nfor example, agreement on goals, brand strategy, \nnames, taglines, and brandmarks.\nSmart organizations often use the branding pro-\ncess to refocus stakeholders on the vision and \nmission of the organization.

Laws governing \nintellectual property advance various policies. \nFederal trademark registration, for example, \nhelps ensure that the consumer is not confused \nor misled by source identifiers that are too  \nsimilar. Trademarks are always registered within \nindustry classes, of which there are forty-five, \nand may be registered in more than one class.\nIntellectual property law is the name of the  \nlegal discipline that specializes in providing the \nbroadest scope of protection for brand assets.  \nA trademark search and analysis by intellectual \nproperty counsel at the outset of a branding  \nprocess can proactively identify and mitigate \nrisks.

During mergers, \nemployees can reply anonymously.\nEthnography\nCustomer behavior is observed in everyday life in \neither a work or home environment.\nFocus groups\nGroup discussions about a predetermined subject are \nled by a moderator with selected participants who \nshare common characteristics. Focus groups uncover \nattitudes, perceptions, needs, and biases. They are \nexcellent for exploring information that is transmitted \nby word of mouth. Online focus groups can be \nconducted with video or chat. \nMystery shopping\nTrained mystery shoppers anonymously visit stores \nand other locations where they pose as customers. \nThey evaluate the shopping experience, \nsalesmanship, professionalism, closing skills, follow-\nup, and overall satisfaction. \nOne-on-one interviews\nIndividual in-depth interviews with senior \nmanagement, customers, and thought leaders are \nideally conducted face-to-face, but may be \nconducted on the phone or Skype.

New insights about attitudes, \nawareness, and behavior of prospects and \ncustomers often indicate opportunities for future \ngrowth. Usability research has finally become \nmore mainstream. \nAlthough anyone can access secondary research \non the web, data alone does not provide \nanswers. Interpretation is a skill in itself. There \nare many proprietary research tools and client \nintelligence competencies to help global \ncorporations develop brand strategy. Smaller \nbranding firms often partner with market \nresearch firms and, in many cases, are provided \nwith existing research reports about customer \npreferences or marketing segments.

Unlike other research \nmethods, usability testing relies on “live” cus-\ntomer experiences with a product. Through the \ncareful observation of a handful of typical users, \nproduct development teams can acquire \nimmediate feedback on the product’s strengths \nand weaknesses. By documenting the actual \nexperiences of people using the product, the \ndevelopment team can isolate and remedy any \ndesign flaws before releasing it to the market. \nThe benefit of this approach is that it makes the \nend user’s needs central to the product develop-\nment process, rather than an afterthought. \nFocus group results are what \nsite visitors think they might do. \nUsability testing shows what \nvisitors actually do.\nKelly Goto & Emily Cotler\nWeb ReDesign 2.0: Workflow that \nWorks\nThe point of testing is not to \nprove or disprove something. \nIt’s to inform your judgment.\nSteve Krug\nDon’t Make Me Think: A Common Sense \nApproach to Web Usability\nUsability testing\nThere’s no substitute for watching and listening to \nusers as they interact with your design, whether it’s  \na product, software, or a service.\nDana Chisnell\nHandbook of Usability Testing\n",

When the Tate in the United Kingdom \nwanted to enhance its appeal and attract more visi-\ntors to its four museums, Sir Nicholas Serota, the \nTate’s director, and his communications staff \nworked closely with Wolff Olins to develop a central \nbrand idea that would unify the different museums. \n“Look again, think again” was an invitation to visitors \nto reconsider their experience of art. \nA need to create brand strategy\nAside from new business creation, mergers are by \nfar the most challenging scenarios that require new \nbrand strategy. Determining a unified strategy and a \nnew name for two companies that may have been \ncompetitors and working with a transition team in a \ncompressed timeframe takes extraordinary skill and \ndiplomacy. VSA Partners created a brand strategy \nand a new name, Cingular, for the joint venture of \nBell South Mobility and SBC Wireless in six weeks. \nThe new name would represent eleven former \nbrands and more than 21 million customers. The \nbrand strategy positioned Cingular as the embodi-\nment of human expression since VSA viewed the \nwireless space evolving from a features-­and-­\nfunctions buying decision to a lifestyle choice.\nIs this chair comfortable?

You \nshould have a compelling reason, and clear \nbusiness benefits, for going through the name \nchange process. Making a strong case for \nchange—whether legal, market-based, or other—\nwill help everyone involved rise above emotional \nissues and enable a more successful and \nmeaningful effort. \nAssess the impact of change. A name change \nis more complicated than creating a new name \nbecause it affects established brand equity and \nall existing brand communications. A thorough \naudit of equity and communication assets should \nbe conducted, to fully understand how a name \nchange will affect your investments and \noperations. \nKnow what your choices are. Depending on \nyour reason for change, it can be very difficult to \nconsider change in the abstract. It is much easier \nto commit to a change when you have alternative \nnames to consider that solve your \ncommunication issues.\nKnow what you are trying to say before you \nname it. Naming is a highly emotional issue that \ncan be hard to judge objectively. By first \nagreeing on what your new name should say, you \nconcentrate your efforts on choosing the name \nthat says it best. \nAvoid trendy names. By definition, these are \nnames that will lose their appeal over time.  \nChoosing a new name simply because it sounds \n“hip” or “cool” generally results in names that \nwear quickly.\n“Empty Vessel Names” require filling. Made-\nup or meaningless names will require more \ninvestment to build understanding, memorability, \nand proper spelling than names that have some \ninherent meaning. Compare the immediate \nmeaning and relevance of names like Google \nand Amazon to empty vessels like Kijiji and \nZoosk.\nAvoid names that are too specific. This may \nbe the reason that change was necessary in the \nfirst place. Names that identify a specific \ngeography, technology, or trend might be \nrelevant for a period of time, but in the long run \nthey could restrict your ability to grow. \nUnderstand that a new name can’t do \neverything. Names are powerful tools, but they \ndo not tell the whole story.  A name change \nalone—without rethinking of all brand \ncommunications—could risk being seen as \nsuperficial. Consider how new taglines, design, \ncommunications, and other context-building tools \nshould work with the new name to build a rich \nnew story that you can own. \nEnsure you can own it. Check patent and \ntrademark offices, common-law usages, URLs, \nTwitter handles, and regional/cultural sensitivities \nbefore you decide, and make the investment to \nprotect your name. This is best done by an \nexperienced intellectual property attorney.\nTransition with confidence. Make sure you \nintroduce your new name as part of a value-\noriented story that conveys clear benefits to your \nemployees, customers, and shareholders. The \nmessage “we’ve changed our name” on its own \ngenerally falls flat. Commit to the change with \nconfidence and implement as quickly and \nefficiently as possible. Having two names in the \nmarket at the same time is confusing to both \ninternal and external audiences. \nIf you wish to make a \nmeaningful statement, a name \nchange is not enough. The \nname should represent a \nunique, beneficial, and \nsustainable story that resonates \nwith customers, investors, and \nemployees.\nPhilip Durbrow\nChairman and CEO\nMarshall Strategy\nCompanies change their names \nfor many reasons, but in every \ncase, a clear rationale for \nchange with strong business \nand brand benefits is critical.\nKen Pasternak\nManaging Director\nMarshall Strategy\n",

Design is an \niterative process that seeks to integrate meaning with form. The best \ndesigners work at the intersection of strategic imagination, intuition, design \nexcellence, and experience. \nExamine\nMeaning\nAttributes\nAcronyms\nInspiration\nHistory\nForm\nCounterform\nAbstract\nPictorial\nLetterform\nWordmark\nCombination\nTime\nSpace\nLight\nStill\nMotion\nTransition\nPerspective\nReality\nFantasy\nStraight\nCurve\nAngle\nIntersection\nPatterns\nReducing a complex idea to its visual essence \nrequires skill, focus, patience, and unending disci-\npline. A designer may examine hundreds of ideas \nbefore focusing on a final choice. Even after a  \nfinal idea emerges, testing its viability begins yet \nanother round of exploration. It is an enormous \nresponsibility to design something that in all prob-\nability will be reproduced hundreds of thousands, \nif not millions, of times and has a lifetime of \ntwenty years or more. \nCreativity takes many roads. In some offices \nnumerous designers work on the same idea, \nwhereas in other offices each designer might  \ndevelop a different idea or positioning strategy. \nRoutinely hundreds of sketches are put up on the \nwall for a group discussion. Each preliminary \napproach can be a catalyst to a new approach. It \nis difficult to create a simple form that is bold, \nmemorable, and appropriate because we live in \nan oversaturated visual environment, making it \ncritical to ensure that the solution is unique and \ndifferentiated. In addition, an identity will need to \nbe a workhorse across various media and \napplications.\nIn projects that involve redesign the designer \nmust also carefully examine the equity of the \nexisting form and understand what it has meant \nto a company’s culture. Paul Rand’s logos for \nUPS, Westinghouse, and Cummins were all \nredesigns. In each case Rand’s genius was \nfinding a way to maintain elements from the \noriginal identity and transform them into bigger \nideas and stronger, more sustainable visual \nforms. His strategy was always to present one \nidea. His brilliant design sensibility was matched \nby his strategic presentations, in which he traced \nthe evolution of his recommendation.\nWe never know what the process will reveal.\nHans-U.

You design for dura-\nbility, for function, for usefulness, for rightness, for \nbeauty. But permanence is up to God and time.”\nPer Mollerup  \nIdentification, description, and the creation of value \nare just some of the possible functions of a \ntrademark.\nHans-U. Allemann \nWe usually begin with very predictable and obvious \nideas, but the beauty of the identity design process \nis that it is totally unpredictable. We never know \nwhat the process will reveal. I have been designing \nmarks for forty years, and the process still aston-\nishes me.\nSteff Geissbuhler \nThe trademark, although a most important element, \ncan never tell the whole story. At best it conveys \none or two notions or aspects of the business. The \nidentity has to be supported by a visual language \nand a vocabulary.\nMalcolm Grear \nForm and counterform. Light and tension. Expanded \nmeaning that is not exhausted at first glance. You \nneed to know the enterprise inside and out.\nPaula Scher\nMy best idea is always my first idea. It took me a \nfew seconds to draw it, but it took me thirty-four \nyears to learn how to draw it in a few seconds.\nLouise Fili\nA logo is a typographic portrait—the face of a busi-\nness. I talk to clients at length, learning everything \nabout who they are and what is important to them, \nand then translate that into type. A great logo \nappears effortless—and is, of course, anything but. \nBart Crosby\nA logotype or a symbol should express the funda-\nmental essence of an organization or a product or a \nservice—the visual manifestation of its nature, its \naspirations, its culture, its reason for being.\nDavid Airey\nTo be a good designer you must be curious about \nlife. The strongest ideas are born from the experi-\nences we have and the knowledge we gain from \nthem.\nChermayeff & Geismar\nWe are looking for the most direct connection \nbetween an idea and the creation of a form. \nSagi Haviv\nIdentity design is not about what one likes or dis-\nlikes. It’s about what works.\nThe best identity  \ndesigners have a strong \nunderstanding of how to \ncommunicate effectively \nthrough the use of signs \nand symbols, a keen sense \nof form and letterforms, \nand an understanding of \nthe history of design.\nHans-U.

Frequently, a logotype is juxtaposed \nwith a symbol in a formal relationship called the \nsignature. Logotypes need to be not only dis­\ntinctive, but durable and sustainable. Legibility  \nat various scales and in a range of media is \nimperative, whether a logotype is silk-­screened \non the side of a ballpoint pen or illuminated in  \nan external sign twenty stories off the ground. \nThe best logotypes are a result of careful typo-\ngraphic exploration. Designers consider the  \nattributes of each letterform, as well as the rela-\ntionships between letterforms. In the best \nlogotypes, letterforms may be redrawn, modified, \nand manipulated in order to express the  \nappropriate personality and positioning of  \nthe company.\nThe designer begins his or her process by exam-\nining hundreds of typographic variations. \nBegin­ning with the basics—for example, whether \nthe name should be set in all caps or caps and \nlowercase—the designer proceeds to look at \nclassic and modern typefaces, roman and italic \nvariations, and various weights, scales, and com-\nbinations. The designer then proceeds to \nmanipulate and customize the logotype. Each \ndecision is driven by visual and performance con-\nsiderations, as well as by what the typography \nitself communicates.\nA signature is the specific and nonnegotiable \ndesigned combination of the brandmark and the \nlogotype. The best signatures have specific isola-\ntion zones to protect their presence. A company \nmay have numerous signatures, for various busi-\nness lines or with and without a tagline.\nSignature\nLogotype\nBrandmark\nThomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest: \nRev Group \n",

A design team has worked hard  \nto get to this point, and it is the culmination of \nmonths of work. The expectations and stakes \nare high. Clients are usually impatient during the \nplanning and analysis phase since they are so \nfocused on the end goal, which is their new \nbrand identity. There is usually a sense of \nurgency around scheduling this meeting. \nEveryone is ready to hit the ground running,  \neven though the implementation phase of the \nwork is not imminent.\nCareful planning is essential to ensure the suc-\ncessful outcome of the meeting. The smartest, \nmost appropriate, and most creative solutions \ncan get annihilated in a mismanaged presenta-\ntion. The larger the group of decision makers,  \nthe more difficult the meeting and the decision \nare to manage. Even presenting to one decision \nmaker alone demands planning in advance.\nDelivering a good presentation is something that \na professional learns through experience and \nobservation. The best presentations stay focused \non the agenda, keep the meeting moving within \nthe scheduled time, set out clear and reasonable \nexpectations, and are based on a decision-­\nmaking process that has been predetermined. \nThe best presenters are well prepared and have \npracticed in advance. They are prepared to deal \nwith any objections and can discuss the design \nsolutions strategically, aligning them with the \noverall brand goals of the company. Larger proj-\nects routinely involve more than one presentation \nand numerous levels of building consensus.\n",

The highest priority now is \nto refine and finalize the elements of the identity \nand to create signatures. This work requires an \nobsessive attention to detail; the files created are \npermanent. Final testing of the signature(s) in a \nvariety of sizes and media is critical. Decisions \nabout typeface families, color palettes, and  \nsecondary visual elements are finalized during \nthis phase.\nWhile the design team is fine-­tuning, the com-\npany is organizing the final list of applications \nthat need to be designed and produced. Core \napplications are prioritized, and content is either \nprovided or developed. The intellectual property \nfirm begins the trademark process, confirming \nwhat needs to be registered and in which \nindustry classes. The lawyers confirm that there \nare no conflicting marks.\nA brand identity program encompasses a unique \nvisual language that will express itself across  \nall applications. Regardless of the medium, the \napplications need to work in harmony. The chal-\nlenge is to design the right balance between \nflexibility of expression and consistency in \ncommunications.\nPhase 4 is about design refinement and design development. The \nbrand identity design concept has been approved, and a sense  \nof urgency generates a fusillade of questions: “When we will  \nget business cards?”, followed by “How soon can we get our \nstandards online?” \nCreating touchpoints: Phase 4 overview\n4 : \u0007creating \ntouchpoints\n",

Unlike traditional  \n“Brand 101” classes, it focuses not just on \neducation, but on creating employee \nengagement and ambassadorship. The module \nuses an assortment of creative and interactive  \nexamples to help illustrate the value of  \nintangible properties such as reputation and \ntrust; for instance, inviting the audience to \nimagine the customer experience of a Deloitte-\nbranded airline. Taken in over 100 countries,  \nthe module has helped shape a network of \nchampions with a deeper understanding of the \npower of brand. \nZappos.com Culture Book\nEach year, Tony Hsieh, CEO, Zappos.com,  \nsends an email to all employees, partners, and \nvendors, asking them to write a few paragraphs \nabout what the culture means to them. The \nsubmissions are unedited, except for typos, \nbecause one of the company’s core values is to \nbuild “open and honest relationships with \ncommunication.” The number one priority at \nZappos is the company culture. Zappos's core \nvalues are embedded within every touchpoint, \nincluding in how the company hires, trains, and \ndevelops employees. The culture and the brand \nare viewed as “two sides of the same coin.” Each \nyear, Zappos publishes a full-color culture book \nfilled with photos and what everyone wrote about \nwhat the culture means to them. It has become \nan annual tradition. The 2010 book was 304 \npages and printed on recycled paper using soy \ninks.\nARAMARK and the road show \nPublic companies routinely use road shows  \nto bring their messages directly to key investors \nand analysts. Road shows are also an effective \ntactic for launching brand initiatives. ARAMARK \nchairman and CEO Joe Neubauer traveled  \nto seven cities to speak to 5,000 frontline \nmanagers to launch his company’s new  \nbrand and to align employees with the vision  \nof the company. “If employees are excited and \nmobilized, then more than half the branding \nbattle has been won,” said Bruce Berkowitz, \nformer director of advertising for ARAMARK. \n“Employees carry the company’s culture and \ncharacter into the marketplace.” \nARAMARK worked with a meeting planning \ncompany to produce a one-­hour road show.  \nThe show included a skit performed by \nBroadway actors and a multimedia  \npresentation of the political, cultural, and \neconomic milestones that gave a context for  \nthe company’s metamorphosis. Neubauer \nreinforced key messages about the company’s \nheritage and its leadership in the industry. His \noverarching message, “Employees are the heart \nof our success and convey our company’s top-­\ntier delivery of services,” was supported by a new \nbrandmark. Designed by the Schechter Group \n(now part of Interbrand), the mark embodies the \nstar quality of the employees and supports the \nnew brand promise of “managed services, \nmanaged better.” \nManagers were fully prepped on the new brand \nvision and strategy. They received an “Ambas­\nsador’s Kit” that contained a company history, \ncopies of the new advertising campaign, a \nmerchandise catalog, and a graphic standards  \nmanual. In addition, the materials included a \nmanager’s checklist and a media launch \nschedule with explicit instructions on how to \nhandle the launch, how to explain it to staff \nmembers, and how to implement the brand \nidentity change. The CEO’s presence and \npassion combined with accessible brand-­ \nbuilding tools were a powerful combination  \nthat fueled ARAMARK’s growth.\nZappos Core Values\nDeliver WOW through \nservice.\nEmbrace and drive change.\nCreate fun and a little \nweirdness.\nBe adventurous, creative,  \nand open-minded.\nPursue growth and learning.\nBuild open and honest \nrelationships with \ncommunication.\nBuild a positive team and \nfamily spirit.\nDo more with less.\nBe passionate and \ndetermined.\nBe humbled.\n",

Users have urgent needs,  \ndifferent levels of proficiency, various software \nplatforms, and a disparate understanding of  \ndigital files, color, and quality. An asset manage-\nment system needs to be diligent about naming, \norganization, storage, retrieval, and overall \nusability of file formats.\nThe designer’s responsibilities are to test all files \nin numerous formats and to develop a retrievable \nsystem that is logical and sustainable. The man-\nager’s responsibility is to determine who has \naccess to files and how best to field all requests. \nIt is no longer unusual to download logo files and \nimages from a website’s media portal.

Some \ndocuments may be viewed \non screen or printed out. \nWhat color space  \nis needed?\nColor information is included \nin a file and interpreted by \nthe output device. \nProfessional printing \ntechniques use spot color \ninks (such as Pantone®) or \nfour-color process inks, \nwhich builds color out of \ncyan, magenta, yellow, and \nblack (CMYK). Color inkjet or \nlaser printers use CMYK \ntoner.\nScreens display color with \nred, blue, and green points of \nlight (RGB). Hex numbers \ndesignate RGB colors for \nHTML code.\nWhat program is \nbeing used?\nIt is important to know the \nprogram being used to \nensure compatibility and to \nfacilitate use of vector \nartwork whenever possible.\nI can’t open it!\nUnless you are going to \nmodify the artwork in a \ndesign program, image files \nshould be inserted or placed, \nnot opened.\nI can’t find it!\nFiles should be named as \nconcisely and informatively \nas possible so they can be \nunderstood at a glance. \nConsistency is imperative for \ngrouping common attributes \nand distinguishing unique \nones.\n",

Because they are based on \nmathematically defined lines and \ncurves, they can be manipulated \nand scaled without losing repro-\nduction quality.\nEPS Encapsulated PostScript\nRaster or bitmap images\nRaster or bitmap images are \ncontinuous-­tone images that are \nconstructed as a continuous \nmapping of pixels. These images \ncannot be scaled, rotated, or \nskewed outside of an image-­\nediting application without the \nloss of reproduction quality.\nResolution\nThe resolution of digital imagery is measured in pixels per inch \n(ppi), the digital equivalent of dots per inch (dpi). The end use \nof the image is critical for determining the optimum resolution.\nFor printing, the higher the resolution the more detail and \nclarity there is to the image, and the larger the file is in terms \nof memory. Offset printing typically requires 300 ppi resolution.\nFor screen display, the pixels in the image map directly to the \npixels on the screen. Images for screen display should be 72 \nppi (Mac) or 96 ppi (PC), but the physical dimensions will be \naffected by the resolution of the display itself. \nFile naming conventions\nFile names should have no more than fifteen characters plus a \nthree-letter file extension (.eps, .jpg, .gif, .doc) indicating what \ntype of file it is.\nDo not use uppercase, spaces, or special characters, such as \n“\\ / : * < > ? ¦. Use a period only before the file extension \nsuffix.\nCreate a system for organizing and identifying those variations \nof the artwork that are required for different applications, such \nas signature, color, sub-brand entity, and file format.\nVector graphics created in a \ndrawing program are saved or \nexported as EPS files so that they \ncan be placed into other \napplications.\nThe highest-quality output for \ngraphic images with hard edges. \nPrinters must have Adobe® \nPostScript®.\nWhen vector graphics are saved \nas TIF, JPG, or other bitmap file \nformat, the hard-edged lines and \ncurves are converted to pixels.\nEPS files created in Adobe \nPhotoshop® are bitmap images \nand will lose clarity when scaled \nor printed.\nTIF Tag Image File Format\nHighest-quality output for \nphotographic images\nBest bitmap version of hard-\nedged graphics—alternative to \nEPS when an Adobe® \nPostScript® printer is unavailable\nConvenient for exchanging image \nfiles between computer platforms \nJPG Joint Photographic \nExperts Group\nCompressed file format for \non-screen viewing of continuous-\ntone photographs\nCompression adds “artifacts” and \nsmears text, lines, and edges\nNot suitable for printing\nGIF Graphics Interchange \nFormat\nCompressed file format for \non-screen viewing of graphics and \nimages in HTML\nNot suitable for printing\nPNG Portable Network Graphic\nFile Format Matrix\t\nPhotographic images \nwith continuous tone\nGraphic images with \nhard edges\nPrinting\t\nDesign software\t\nTIF\t\n   EPS\n\t\n\u0007Adobe Illustrator®, Adobe Photoshop®  \nCorelDRAW®, QuarkXpress®, Adobe InDesign®\n\t\nOffice software\t\nTIF\t\n   TIF (PNG)\n\t\nMicrosoft Word®, Microsoft Excel®\t\n\t\nConverts vector graphics to bitmap image\nScreen\t\nDesign software\t\nJPG\t\n   GIF (PNG, TIF)\n\t\nAdobe ImageReady®, among others \n\t\nOffice software\t\nJPG\t\n   TIF (PNG)\n\t\nPowerPoint®\nThese are just a few of \nthe most widely used \nformats.\n",

ACHC \nexecutives worked collaboratively to substantiate \nhow Iñupiat values shape the way ACHC and its \nsubsidiaries conduct business. There was unilat-\neral agreement that the brand architecture needed \nto support and clearly communicate the fact that \nACHC and the six subsidiaries work together as a \nunified team to provide unique efficiencies and \nvalue. It became clear that the final identity system \nhad to communicate that each of the companies \nwas part of something larger. A unified naming \nconvention was developed to convey brand \nstrength and support future growth through \nmergers and acquisitions. The ACHC Family of \nCompanies was born, and became the platform for \nthe creative process.\nCreative solution: Salminen designed a simple \nand bold brandmark that forms a shield around a \nbowhead whale tail. The bowhead is regarded as \nthe longest-­living mammal and lives exclusively  \nin the Arctic. In the Iñupiat culture, the bowhead \nwhale is a powerful symbol of community, cooper-\nation, fairness, integrity, leadership, respect, and \nteamwork, which are the values of the ACHC \nFamily of Companies. The white curve and lower \nshape represent the vast Arctic horizon. The brand \narchitecture system positions the companies as \none unified entity, and embraces cultural heritage. \nThe parent company and subsidiaries each have \none predominant designated color. The color pal-\nette was crafted to speak directly to the \ngeographical location of the Iñupiat people, with \ncolor names such as Bowhead Gray, Baleen Black, \nIce Blue, and Wetland Green. In addition to devel-\noping identity standards, Salminen designed \ncollateral materials, signage, magazine ads, \napparel, field gear, and seven websites.\nResults: The new identity and brand architecture \nsystem has made it easier for existing clients and \nprospects to understand that each of the ACHC \ncompanies has a unique focus in the construction \nindustry, and leverages the full technical, logistical, \nand personnel resources of the entire organiza-\ntion. To launch the brand internally, each employee \nwas presented with a stylish coffee tumbler, a \nwater bottle, and an invitation to experience the \nnewly launched websites. An unanticipated benefit \nof the process was a proud workplace and a \nrenewed internal energy. \nThe strategic process was  \nthe core foundation and  \nmain driver that helped  \neveryone involved make \ninformed design decisions.\nSini Salminen\nDesigner and Brand Consultant\nACHC: Sini Salminen\n213\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The ACLU set out to \nreach a broader constituency and build member-\nship, and asked Fo Wilson Group to customize a \nteam to build a unified, meaningful identity. The Fo \nWilson Group, a design consultancy, was joined by \nSylvia Harris, an information design strategist, and \nMichael Hirschhorn, an organizational dynamics \nexpert. In the audit, the team found more than fifty \nlogos. Every state affiliate had its own logo, \nwebsite design, and architecture, with little con-\nnection to the national organization. Other \nadvocacy organizations were studied, and Harris \nfound that the “ACLU represents a set of princi-\nples, while most other advocacy groups represent \na constituency.” The team interviewed a wide \nrange of stakeholders, including affiliates, commu-\nnications staff, and members. The most frequently \nmentioned attribute that defined the ACLU was \n“principled,” followed by “justice” and “guardian.” A \nsurvey conducted in 2000 by Belden, Russonello \n& Stewart found that “over 8 out of 10 Americans \n(85%) had heard of the ACLU.” The team realized \nthat the ACLU identity needed to be recognized in \na wide variety of arenas, from town halls to court-\nrooms and campuses.\nCreative solution: The design directive was to \ncapitalize on a highly recognizable acronym, and to \nconnect ACLU principles and the spirit of freedom \nto the acronym. Fo Wilson Group designed a \nseries of signatures with a contemporary logotype \nand expressive symbolism. Several options were \ntested for the modular system that used patriotic \nimagery. During the audit, the team found that the \nACLU’s original symbol from the 1930s was the \nStatue of Liberty, and it had been dropped in the \n1980s. The Statue of Liberty tested the best, and \nalthough other advocacy groups used the symbol, \nthe ACLU decided to return to its legacy and his-\ntory. A unique photographic perspective of the \nstatue’s face was stylized, and a photographic sig-\nnature was adopted to work in the digital \nenvironment. A range of applications demon-\nstrated how the system worked, from website \narchitecture to newsletters and membership cards. \nThe flexible system needed to work for the \nnational office, the affiliates, the foundations, and \nspecial projects.\nResults: The ACLU’s leadership group \nchampioned the identity initiative from the early \nplanning through the analysis, decision making, \nand rollout. The identity team conducted a series \nof phone conference presentations to the \naffiliates. Educational programs for staff were \nconducted at the headquarters.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Tablets require the ability \nto create, design, distribute, monetize, and optimize \nengaging content and publications. Adobe wanted \nto inspire designers and other professional users \nto adopt Adobe® Digital Publishing Suite (DPS). \nAdobe’s strategy was to provide a free quarterly \napp that would make it easy to learn new tools \nthrough experimentation and play. Adobe engaged \nMarcolina Slate, a firm with advanced experience \nin DPS, to design a branding framework that \nwould engage users, accelerate learning, and build \ncommunity. Adobe identified leaders within its user \ncommunity to both create initial submission mate-\nrials and encourage broader community \nparticipation. Marcolina visualized a whimsical \n“swap meet” atmosphere, and created a series of \neasy-to-use templates in Adobe InDesign that art-\nists could populate with their content and at the \nsame time explore DPS. It would also put their \nwork and name in front of the large Adobe user \ncommunity by giving them means to share tuto-\nrials of their creation on the topics of imaging, \nvideo, web, and design in free downloadable \nissues on iTunes.\nCreative solution: How do you create a commu-\nnity app that offers a rewarding, fun, and \neducational experience for community members, \nin order to encourage participation? Technically, \nMarcolina wanted it to showcase the best interac-\ntive possibilities available in an easy-to-use \nInDesign package. iTunes browsers can see and \ndownload the most recent issue. There are four \ndifferent branded covers for Digital Imaging, Video, \nWeb, and Design. For the tutorial authors \nMarcolina created five distinct templates, each \ndependent on the skill level or type of tutorial \n(video versus web) being built. As an incentive, \nthere are also three profile templates where the \nartists can tell their story or show a larger array of \nwork to the world. Since creating an interactive \ntablet document in InDesign is new and somewhat \ncomplex, Marcolina built pre-rigged template \nassets that allowed newcomers to add content in \na step-by-step manner with detailed instructions \nand tutorial links with every template. \nResults: In July, the Community Publishing App \nwas launched on iTunes and many contributing \nauthors have begun to experience the excitement \nof digital publishing with DPS. Cross-promotions \nappeared on Adobe blogs, social media, and \nforums. Marketing extended to partner sites, user \ngroups, Adobe Community Professionals, AIGA, \ndesign schools, art organizations, and current DPS \nusers. Updates will be delivered in-app as issues \nare created and appear as a normal update alert in \nthe App Store.\n217\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Palmer West and Jonah \nSmith, Los Angeles-­based film producers, created \nAether Apparel to fill a gap in the market. As out-\ndoor sport enthusiasts, they found that most \nperformance-­driven apparel companies lacked  \ndesign or style, and most fashion lines did not  \nfeature technical advancements in outerwear. \nTheir target market was the discerning customer \nwho appreciated high-­style, high-­quality, high-­\nperformance clothing and wanted to show it, both \non the streets of Manhattan and on the ski slopes \nof Park City. They engaged Carbone Smolan \nAgency (CSA) to design a brand platform and \nwebsite that would elevate the company from \nstart-­up to established luxury brand. The founders \nnamed their company Aether, meaning “upper air,” \na reference to the air that Greek gods breathed on \nOlympus. In extensive interviews, CSA found that \nthe core brand message was focused on style, \nfunction, and a surprisingly simple promise from \nthe founders, “If we personally do not want  \nto wear it, we will not make it.”\nCreative solution: CSA designed a mark based \non the Aether A to evoke clouds swirling around a \nmountain peak. The iconic mark and logotype \nwere designed to reflect the simple aesthetic of \nthe clothes themselves. “The white logotype on \nblack epitomizes the striking yet minimalist quality \nof the garments and provides just enough ‘urban \ncool’ to stand out in a market filled with excess,” \nsays Ken Carbone. The full system of brand appli-\ncations included clothing labels, hangtags, ads, \nlook books, and an e-­commerce website. The \nbrand comes to life on the website, where dra-\nmatic and evocative environmental photography \ntransports the viewer to the road to nowhere and \neverywhere, setting the mood for beauty, adven-\nture, and mystery. The website itself has a clear \nstructure for easily viewing products, which are  \nimpeccably photographed. Product names like \nAtmosphere, Flatlands, and Space appeal to a  \nnew generation of world adventure travelers that \nare as comfortable rock climbing on a glacier as \nthey are bar hopping in Soho.\nResults: Aether Apparel is actively growing and \nbreaking into new markets and new marketing \nchannels. Their year-to-year growth is in the triple \ndigits, the expanding product line includes wom-\nen’s wear and swimwear, and their retail presence \nhas gone from web-only to selling products at \nJ.Crew. In 2011, Aether launched the \nAetherStream roving pop-­up shop, a 34-­foot \nAirstream showroom on wheels designed by \nThierry Gaugain that made its way to Los Angeles, \nNew York, and San Francisco.\nAether Apparel is where Prada \nmeets Patagonia, and where \nhigh style meets high function. \nThis luxury brand is a hybrid of \nfashion and adventure.\nKen Carbone\nCofounder and Chief Creative Director\nCarbone Smolan Agency\nAether Apparel: Carbone Smolan Agency\n219\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In 1999 Amazon.com  \nretained Turner Duckworth to redesign its brand \nidentity. Amazon.com’s positioning as a customer-­\nfocused, friendly company was the core of its  \nmission and values. The challenge was to create  \na unique and proprietary identity that maintained \nwhat Amazon.com believed were its brand equi-\nties: lowercase type in the logo, and an orange \nswoosh underneath the name. Turner Duckworth \nimmersed itself in the brand, spent a lot of time on \nthe website, and examined competitor sites. The \nfirm also analyzed what makes a logo effective or \nineffective on the web. “Our goal was to infuse \npersonality into the logo, and to create a compel-\nling idea that would convey the brand message,” \nsaid David Turner, head of design.\nCreative solution: The design team developed \ndistinct visual strategies at the first stage; each \none emphasized a different aspect of the posi-\ntioning brief. The final logo design was an \nevolutionary leap from the old logo. The central \nidea behind the new logo reflected the client’s \nbusiness strategy of selling more than just books. \nThe design team connected the initial a of \n“amazon” to the z. This approach clearly communi-\ncated “Amazon.com sells everything from A to Z.” \nThe graphic device that connects the a and the z \nalso speaks to the brand positioning: customer \nfocus and friendly service. This device forms a \ncheeky smile with a dimple that pushes up the z. \nThe brown shipper box packaging was considered \nat every stage of the logo design. Turner \nDuckworth designed custom lettering for the \nwordmark and made the “amazon” more prominent \nthan the “.com.” The typography was designed to \ngive the logo a friendlier and unique look. The \ndesign team also designed a full alphabet so that \nAmazon.com could update its inter­national \ndomains, currently in the United Kingdom, \nGermany, France, and Japan. The project was \ncompleted in eight weeks.\nResults: Jeff Bezos, the CEO, founder, and \nvisionary, was involved at every presentation and \nwas the key decision maker. Amazon.com had \ndetermined that it would execute a “soft launch” of \nthe new identity. The new brand identity was not \nannounced to the press or highlighted on its \nwebsite. Sensitive to the perceptions of customers \nand Wall Street analysts, the company felt it was  \nimportant that Amazon.com did not appear to be  \na “different” company. Amazon.com will always be \nconsidered the e-commerce company that \nchanged the future of retailing forever. The \nAmazon Kindle was introduced in 2007 and has \nled a new generation of e-book readers. \nAccess to the key decision \nmaker, and in particular to \nthe visionary of a company, \ncertainly makes our work \neasier. Not only does it \naccelerate the feedback, \ndevelopment and approval \nprocesses, but it also allows \nus to ask questions of the \nvisionary and hear unedited \nanswers.\nJoanne Chan\nHead of Client Services\nTurner Duckworth\nWhen you have a leader with \ntrue vision and enthusiasm, \nit becomes contagious and \ninspires the team. \nJaleh Bisharat\nFormer VP of Marketing\nAmazon.com\n221\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In 2005, the Russian  \nmobile communications market was approaching \nsaturation, especially in Moscow. The principal \nplayers were competing for the leading position in \nthe market and there was no clear point of differ-\nentiation between them. The competitive audit \nrevealed that marketing and branding in the \nmobile communications sector was focused \nmostly on technology rather than people. Wolff \nOlins was engaged to create a new brand identity \nthat would build an emotional bond with con-\nsumers in order to retain loyalty. The other \nprerequisite for the new brand was to provide an \noutward-­looking, more modern face that would \nhelp the company prepare for regional and inter-\nnational expansion. The competitive audit also \nrevealed that the market in general was cluttered \nand noisy. The opportunity for Wolff Olins was \nclear—create a brand that could stand out and cut \nthrough the noise. The brand team worked closely \nwith Beeline’s marketing team in Moscow to \ndeliver a brand that was bold and that delivered \nmaximum impact.\nCreative solution: Inspired by the company’s \nstrategy, Wolff Olins developed a working platform \nto focus the work. “Beeline inspires me to live  \nlife to the fullest” was the idea used to drive all  \naspects of the creative work, both visually and ton-\nally. The solution was not just a logo but a \ncomplete and coherent language that was flexible \nand universal, that captured the imagination of dif-\nferent audiences across Russia and that \ntranscended cultural and social barriers. Visually, it \nwas an invitation to see life with imagination, illus-\ntrated by the use of black and yellow stripes in an \nindividual and ownable way. The new tagline, “Live \non the bright side”, informed the tone for the new \nbrand’s personality. Brightness, friendliness, sim-\nplicity, and positive emotions would be the new \nattributes of the revitalized brand. A new brand \nidentity system, communications style guidelines, \nand an image library were created to get the com-\npany ready for the launch. Wolff Olins was also \ncommissioned to create the launch campaign.\nResults: The rebrand was a great success. At  \nthe end of 2005 revenue was up by 40 percent, \nmarket capitalization by 28 percent, and average \nrevenue per user by 7 percent. Wolff Olins con-\ntinues to work with Beeline as it grows into new \nregions and product areas. Since relaunching the \nbrand, Beeline has been inde­pendently ranked the \nmost valuable brand in Russia for three consecu-\ntive years, according to Interbrand Zintzmeyer & \nLux in Business Week. \n223\n",

The John Deere Foundation sup-\nports initiatives in education, the environment, and \ncommunity development. The Bela União school \nensures that the children in Horizontina, a small \nrural town in southern Brazil, have a place to learn \nand to go when their parents are working. Bela \nUnião means beautiful union in Portuguese, which \nis the native language of Brazil. The teachers \nbelieved that the school should have a logo  \nso they drew one. In May 2011, the John Deere \nFoundation decided to engage the Criativia  \nBrand Studio to design a simple identity for the \nschool that that conveyed a feeling about the \nschool, and “Planting social responsibility. \nHarvesting citizenship.“\nCreative solution: Criativia decided to emphasize \nthe most characteristic sentiment of the Latin \nAmerican people—love. “Love is the way that we \nmake dreams come true. Love is what we feel \nwhen we know that our children have a brighter \nperspective for their future, “ said Ricardo \nSalvador, director of Criativia. After exploring a \nrange of possibilities, Criativia decided that the \nbest image would be a heart—not just any heart, \nbut one that could represent simplicity and at the \nsame time the letter B from the word “Bela”. So \nthey drew a continuous line to combine those two \nideas in one unique symbol. The color red was \nchosen because of its strong connotation to love. \nThe typeface and the lettering were designed to \nwork with the symbol, maintaining its simplicity \nand meaning. The entire logo works well in gray \nscale or in black and white since maintains its legi-\nbility, and that’s important for a school that can’t \nalways print in color.\nResults: Today, when the inhabitants of \nHorizontina see children wearing t-shirts with  \na heart in the shape of the letter B they know  \nthat those children are safe from the streets  \nand on their way to a better future. The children \nwear the school T-shirts each day like a school \nuniform.

As a result, \nthe neighborhood is strengthened and kids experi-\nence the joy of earning and owning a bike. In 2011, \nthe shop was a beneficiary of Matchstic’s annual \npro bono branding project, On The House. \nMatchstic and other partner companies joined \ntogether to increase the shop’s efforts to impact \nthe city of Atlanta, all free of charge. Matchstic \nbegan the process by developing a brand brief, \npositioning the shop’s unique approach to commu-\nnity development through “Kids Earning Bikes.” \nMatchstic developed a visual program that clearly \ncommunicated the story across all critical \ntouchpoints to garner the support and respect of \ncommunity members and encourage bike enthusi-\nasts to get involved. \nCreative solution: “Matchstic’s design encapsu-\nlates everything the bike shop is: kid-friendly \nwithout being childish, hopeful, and a little gritty. It \nspeaks to the coming together of a community \nwith the goal of building strong neighborhoods \nwhere kids can grow up,” says director Tim O’Mara. \nThe bold, yellow mark features a stylized illustra-\ntion of a bicycle; two wrenches—the most \ncommonly used tools in the shop—form the bicy-\ncle’s tires.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In fall 2008, the California \nAcademy of Sciences unveiled its iconic new \nbuilding that exists beneath a 2.5-­acre living roof. \nThe $488 million all-­green, LEED Platinum \nCertified museum was designed by Renzo Piano. \nPentagram was engaged to design an identity and \nvisual system that celebrates the Academy’s \ndynamic, thriving, and interconnected experience, \nand complements its state-­of-­the-art facilities. The \ncomprehensive identity system needed to include \ncollateral, development, and membership mate-\nrials; interior and exterior signs, banners, and \ndonor walls; newsletters, membership cards, and \nvisitor maps; and more. Pentagram’s Kit Hinrichs \nand Laura Scott worked closely with the \nAcademy’s senior leadership team, building archi-\ntects, and other design consultants, to create a \ncohesive brand experience to increase recogni-\ntion, visitation, membership, and support.\nCreative solution: Taking inspiration from the \nbuilding’s architecture, the Academy’s new identity \nreinforces the cyclical nature of the natural sci-\nences, and is often described as “The Fabric  \nof Life.” Everything was designed to have an  \nunexpected element of discovery and engage-\nment—like a photograph with a twist or scale \nlarger than life, or the twenty-one-foot diameter \nlogo at the entryway inset into the ground so chil-\ndren can trace its outline with their feet. For the \ndevelopment newsletters, the theme “Life Stories” \nwas created; oversized newsletters bring to life \nstories of people who have infused their passion \ninto or been impassioned by the Academy, be they \nstaff, donors, docents, enthusiasts, volunteers, \nresearchers, scientists, aspiring scientists, or wide-­\neyed kids. Pentagram also created a series of \ndonor walls. The major donor wall is a permanent \ninstallation of 388 six-­inch-­square glass blocks, a \nmodern take on scientific “specimen boxes” that \nhave been etched with names of major contribu-\ntors. True to its sustainability mission, every \nelement is designed with environmental responsi-\nbility in mind; membership cards are printed on \nrecycled plastic and issued for the lifetime of the \nmember, and visitor maps are printed on recycled \npaper and designed to be reused.\nResults: The new California Academy of Sciences \nhas been met with unprecedented local, national, \nand international enthusiasm. Membership has \ngrown to over 75,000 in the first six months (up \nfrom 16,000 in 2004 when the Academy closed \nfor reconstruction). Attendance has far exceeded \nits ambitious opening goals and, just five months \nafter the opening, the Academy celebrated its \none-­millionth visitor.\nDonor wall\nPhotos: Tim Griffith\nCalifornia Academy of Sciences: Pentagram\n229\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Carnegie Fabrics, a \nleading textile dealer and manufacturer known for  \nits eco-­friendly textiles, was faced with increased \ncompetition and dwindling face-­to-­face inter­\nactions in its showrooms between its sales team, \ndesigners, and buyers. The Carbone Smolan \nAgency (CSA) was engaged to envision the best \nway to bring Carnegie’s robust product line and \nexpertise online, and to amplify Carnegie’s status \nas a premier design brand. How could a website \nmake it easier for interior designers, architects, \nand facility managers to choose from hundreds  \nof offerings? CSA determined that Carnegie’s \nhigh-quality service, ease of browsing, and range \nof choices needed to be conveyed as fluently \nonline as it was in the company’s brick-and-mortar \nshowrooms. CSA led focus groups of designers \nand buyers to gain insights into unmet needs, \nchallenges, and optimal workflow. The sales team \nsought a solution that highlighted superior cus-\ntomer service and integrity. The buyers \ndiagrammed their work process, and CSA simpli-\nfied the matrix of the multitude of choices.\nCreative solution: CSA created an online show-\nroom to integrate customer needs with Carnegie’s \nofferings. Accessibility was the guiding force in \nthe design, simplifying Carnegie’s extensive selec-\ntion through an intuitive interface with detailed \ncategorization, accessible navigation menus, and \nheightened search functionality. The site works  \nby mirroring the way clients like to search, allowing \nthem to browse, navigate, and sort Carnegie’s  \ncollections: first by selecting use, then color, price, \npatterns, and other customizable options. One  \nof the key technological enhancements is a  \nrendering section that allows designers to immedi-\nately see how their chosen upholstery, wall \ncovering, or drapery options will look in a space. To \nfurther enhance the new website, CSA refreshed \nthe existing identity by incorporating a bold color \npalette and designing a multicolored, dynamic ver-\nsion of the existing logo to be used as a “billboard” \non the site’s home page. The identity treatment \ndrives a coordinated advertising campaign to \nlaunch the new online showroom and the rest of \nCarnegie’s marketing communications.\nResults: The new website distinguishes Carnegie \nas a leader in the textile marketplace. The ren-\ndering section and the simplified sample ordering \nsystem were publicized as industry game \nchangers. Since the site launched, monthly visits \nand the number of clients using online accounts  \nhave grown, and Carnegie has seen a 6 percent \nincrease in online sample orders. The richness  \nof the site as a marketing resource replaces the \nneed for printed marketing materials, cementing \nCarnegie’s status as an eco-­friendly company.\nCarnegie: Carbone Smolan Agency\n231\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: When typeface designers \nRobbie de Villiers, founder of Wilton Foundry, and \nJeremy Dooley, founder of Insigne Design, met in \n2011, they spoke of their collective dream to \ndesign a typeface for Chattanooga. Surrounded by \nmountains and rivers, the city has a lively culture of \nentrepreneurship, a burgeoning design community, \nand an eclectic music scene. De Villiers, originally \nfrom South Africa, now calls Chattanooga his \nhome. Dooley moved to Chattanooga after years \nof travel. Both typographers have designed fonts \nfor big brands like Nike and GE. Being two of \nsome 300 professional typeface designers glob-\nally, they had the expertise and experience to \nexecute their vision. The typographers decided to \njoin forces with brand consultants and business \npartners DJ Trischler and Jonathan Mansfield from \nD+J Identity to set a plan and launch a campaign. \nThey all believed that Chattanooga, a municipality \nwith a population of 500,000, was at the right \ndevelopmental stage to adopt and embrace a \nstrong, citywide visual identity. \nCreative solution: While Dooley and de Villiers \ncontinued developing the typeface, D+J began \nefforts to introduce the initiative to the larger com-\nmunity. The typeface designers consulted historian \nDean Arnold to consider influences from \nChattanooga’s past, and reflected on the city’s \nmodern industrial identity. The team presented the \nidea at an event. The four team members had \nagreed that Kickstarter, a project crowd-funding \nsite, would be the right vehicle to promote and \nraise support for the effort. Kickstarter allows \nteams to set a fundraising goal for creative proj-\nects and post a video explaining the project and \nwhy it deserves funding. Mansfield and Trischler \nplanned, filmed, edited, and produced the \nKickstarter video, which featured local creatives \nand used design and writing skills to communicate \nand highlight the work. \nResults: The Kickstarter goal was exceeded. A \nwell-written, in-depth article on the front page  \nof the local newspaper spread to design blogs, \nnews sites, and media sources all over the  \ncountry and internationally, including Time.com, \nFast Company, Good magazine, Monocle, and \nNational Geographic Traveler.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Coca-Cola is the most \nvaluable and recognized brand in the world. Its \ntrademark and contour bottle design are ubiqui-\ntous cultural icons. In late 2005, Coca-Cola North \nAmerica engaged Turner Duckworth with the \ndesign goal of making the brand feel happy, fresh, \nand honest. The process began with analyzing \nCoca-Cola’s heritage and visual assets, and dem-\nonstrating how leadership brands use design and \nvisual identity to achieve a competitive advantage. \nThere was agreement that Coca-Cola’s identity \nhad become cluttered, uninspiring, and static. \nGiven the rapid pace of change in today’s con-\nsumer society, the team felt that Coca-Cola’s \nidentity needed to be dynamic and constantly \nrelevant to the culture. Turner Duckworth identified \nfive principles of iconic brands to guide the design \nthinking against the brand idea “Coke brings joy.”\nCreative solution: Turner Duckworth focused on \nCoca-Cola’s iconic elements that no other brand \ncan own: the white Spencerian script on a red \nbackground, the trademark contour bottle, and the \ndynamic ribbon. Turner Duckworth showed what \nthe design of “Coke brings joy” looks like and feels \nlike across multiple touchpoints, from cups to \ntrucks to environments. Turner Duckworth exam-\nined the entire visual identity toolbox: trademarks, \nicons, color, scale, symbols, patterns, forms, typog-\nraphy, and photography. At various stages of the \nprocess, designs were sent into research to verify \nthat they were aligned with company strategy. The \nnew bold and simple design strategy leveraged \nthe trademark’s enduring and emotional appeal. \nThe design has the simplicity, confidence, and flex-\nibility to work in different environments and media. \nIt was designed to be in tune with the culture. The \nvalue of design leadership was discussed with key \ndecision makers. The new design guidelines were \ndeveloped and posted online for suppliers, creative \npartners, and design centers around the world.\nResults: The revitalized visual identity has made \nthe brand relevant to a new generation, recon-\nnected with people who grew up with the brand \nand increased sales. Turner Duckworth and the \nCoca-Cola Company received a number of global \nawards including the coveted Design Grand Prix at \nthe Cannes Lions International Festival of \nCreativity and the Gold Lion for its aluminum \nbottle. The design strategy gave Coca-Cola a new \nleadership position that is now expanding across \nother key brands. Furthermore, it has helped the \ncompany attract creative talent from organizations \nlike Nike and Apple.\nThe secret to making \nwork like this happen \nis passion, persuasion, \nand perseverance.\nDavid Turner\nPrincipal\nTurner Duckworth\nCoca-Cola: Turner Duckworth\n235\n",

Its mission is to bring the Deloitte brand to \nlife, and build brand eminence with practitioners, \nclients, and communities around the world. \nExternal research substantiated the need to shift \nthe perception of Deloitte as just a Big Four \naccounting and tax firm to that of a professional \nprovider with a diversified, multi-­functional service \noffering. In 2008, the team examined strategies \nbased on three core brand attributes: anticipation, \nrelentlessness, and pragmatism. The new posi-\ntioning platform, Always One Step Ahead, was \nenvisioned to radically differentiate Deloitte from \nits leading competitors by creating a category of \none. This internal platform needed a strong \nexternal form of expression to spark recognition \nacross media, and resonate in numerous global \nmarketplaces and cultures. The independent \nmember firms were introduced to the new, \norganization-­wide call to action, and the Global \nBrand team began a process to leverage local \ninsights and expertise to determine the most \neffective implementation.\nCreative solution: The global brand team worked \nwith two agencies, The Partners and Muir Howard, \nto develop a dynamic and timeless visual lan-\nguage. Following more than six months of \ndevelopment and intensive collaboration, the \n“green dot campaign” was launched. The green \ndot, a signature element of the Deloitte logo, was \nthe inspiration. This solitary, large iconic green dot \nbecame the focus of a creative and brand centric \nmultichannel communication strategy. Although \nthere can only be one green dot in any visual, the \nmessaging possibilities proved to be infinite. A \nrange of treatments was conceptualized to  \ndemonstrate the flexibility, power, and latitude of \nthe system, and a “green dot toolbox,” containing \nsample ads and design guidelines for consistency \nin look, feel, and messaging was developed. All  \nassets were housed on Brand Space, Deloitte’s \nglobal brand content management system, for \neasy access by all Deloitte member firm profes-\nsionals and approved vendors.\nResults: In 2010, Deloitte became the largest \nprofessional services firm in the world. Despite  \na decentralized structure, member firms have real-\nized the value of a consistently applied brand  \ntoward achieving key strategic objectives. The \ncampaign’s bold visual style and provocative mes-\nsaging has accelerated marketplace recognition, \nand has paid dividends inside the organization  \nas well. In the first and largest brand engagement \nprogram of its kind, 182,000 employees were \nasked to create their own green dot ad concepts, \ncrafting a unique and authentic brand experience.\nOur brand positioning informs \neverything we do—from internal \ntalent initiatives to external \ncommunications campaigns.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Torres wants to create  \na new market of passionate wine lovers in China. \nTorres conducted initial market research to under-\nstand opportunities for a business-­to-­consumer \nwine retail brand and to solidify their brand \nstrategy and positioning. Labbrand, a brand \nconsultancy headquartered in Shanghai, was \nengaged to create the English and Chinese brand \nnames and to design the visual identity system. \nThe brand naming methodology started with the \ndevelopment of a creative brief, followed by sev-\neral rounds of brainstorming as well as software \ngeneration to come up with thousands of potential \nname candidates. After an initial selection, a smart \nlegal check was conducted to search for existing \niden­tical or similar trademarks. A linguistic check \nwas then carried out to rule out potentially nega-\ntive meanings or associations in the various \nChinese dialects, including Cantonese, Mandarin, \nShang­hainese, Sichuanese, and Taiwanese. Finally, \nthe top ten Chinese brand names were tested in  \nconsumer focus groups.\nCreative solution: The English name, Everwines, \nreflects the brand attributes of self-­enjoyment, \nself-­expression, and the importance of time to \ncreate a fine wine. The final Chinese name chosen \nwas \n (y\u001fong táo). \n (y\u001fong) means to sing or \npraise; it also is pronounced the same as \n \n(y\u001fong, “forever”), thus corresponding to “Ever” in \nthe English name. \n (táo) means grape, the \nsource of wine. Both the English and Chinese \nnames are expressive and appealing while being \neasy for Chinese customers to read and \nremember. Lab­brand designed an attractive visual \nidentity system for Everwines that was inspired by \na plen­titude of grapes, and a sense of discovery \nand enlightenment about a new range of tastes \nand sensations. The identity is displayed in \nEverwines retail spaces and on promotional items,  \npackaging, and marketing materials, as well as on \nthebrand website and the iPad app. The interior of  \nthe Everwines shops was designed by Naço \nArchitecture.\nResults: The Everwines brand’s young, appealing, \nand cosmopolitan image supports Torres’s goal of \nbecoming a leading retail wine chain in China. The \nmodern and approachable stores, an e-­commerce \nwebsite, and a VIP club and wine education pro-\ngrams have helped consumers shift their \nperception and desire for high-­quality wines. The \nshop is also the first in Shanghai to use an iPad \nwine list. Wine lovers can select their choice of \nwine through this innovative technology.\nEverwines: Labbrand\n239\n",

It has been diligent about \nprotecting its brand assets (name, trademark, \ntagline) and its monolithic brand architecture is \napplied consistently across sectors and around the \nworld. Continuous improvement requires that \nexisting processes and tools be reevaluated peri-\nodically to be sure they are clear, state-of-the-art, \nand engaging. In 2008, the GE Brand \nManagement staff began a process to validate \ncurrent practices and recommend improvements. \nThis started with surveys of GE Brand Central \nusers to determine issues and opportunities \nmoving forward. The results identified several \nareas for improvement, including how information \nis organized and searchable; cataloging of \nresources such as logo, image and template files; \nintegration of best practices; and establishing a \nplatform with expansion capabilities. Executive \nsupport was secured to move into a site enhance-\nment project that would shift the focus from \nguideline compliance to brand engagement.\nCreative solution: GE partnered with Monigle \nAssociates to develop the next generation GE \nBrand Central. The initial steps for the project \nwere focused on integrating the summary of the \nsurvey results into a scope of work document that \nwould deliver an enhanced experience for users \nand improve brand management processes. \nSpecific functions and content were identified, as \nwell as future phase modules to extend the site \nover the long term. The project required collabora-\ntion with agencies as well as GE’s design team. \nThe new configuration includes a more robust \nbrand strategy section, enhanced guidelines and \npolicies, new search functionality to distribute \nbrand assets, a best practices library, project man-\nagement tools to collect new creative services \nprojects and manage them through implementa-\ntion, and a content management system to \nfacilitate site updates by GE Brand Management \nteam members and agencies. \nResults: GE Brand Central was relaunched in \nFebruary 2009, supported by a significant com-\nmunications campaign to build awareness and \nusage. The site is generating consistently positive \nreviews from both power and occasional users. \nFeedback validates that key improvement objec-\ntives have been met. Site usage is up 25% \ncompared to peak usage patterns of the previous \nsite. Other metrics track efficiencies in creative \nservices project submissions, distribution of brand \nassets, most popular content, and overall ROI con-\ntribution of the site.

GE’s brand management  \nteam works closely with the International  \nOlympic Committee (IOC) to ensure compliance. \nSubsequently, GE expanded its sponsorship \nstrategy to include Formula One (F1) and  \nPGA programs.\nCreative solution: GE engaged Monigle \nAssociates to codevelop an enterprise-wide \nresource center for all content and resources \nrelated to sponsorship brand communications  \nand implementation. The successful goals, \nmethodology, and infrastructure of the GE Brand \nCentral site were first applied to the GE Olympic \nCentral site, and then repurposed to become  \nthe GE Sponsorship Central site. The project \nrequired collaboration with GE’s design team \nand partner agencies, as well as the IOC, F1, and \nPGA. Since GE employees and agencies were \nfamiliar with the GE Brand Central site, the adop-\ntion to sponsorship content and resources was a  \nnatural solution. \nResults: The process has streamlined program \ndevelopment through agency and employee col-\nlaboration. It has effectively managed required \napprovals and helped GE businesses follow guide-\nlines and policies for each sponsorship program. It \nhas engaged and captured the imagination of GE \nemployees all around the world and helped  \nraise awareness of GE’s efforts in Olympic, F1, \nand PGA sponsorships. Like the GE Brand \nCentral, metrics are being used to track usage  \nand efficiencies.\nGE Sponsorship Central: Monigle Associates\n243\n",

Global Hand­\nwashing Day was established in 2008 by PPPHW \nto motivate people around the world to adopt \nhandwashing with soap. Once October 15 was  \nestablished as Global Handwashing Day, PPPHW \ndecided that a unique and ownable visual identity \nwas needed for the global campaign. The identity \nneeded to translate easily across multiple cultures \nand languages to communicate its powerful, life-\nsaving message. Procter & Gamble (part of \nPPPHW’s international coalition of stakeholders) \nand its Safeguard brand team asked Landor \nAssociates to create an identity for an annual \ncampaign that would help transform handwashing \nwith soap from an abstract good idea into an auto-\nmatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and \ncommunities worldwide. The firm began its pro-\ncess by auditing other successful \nbehavior-­changing global campaigns to establish \ndesign criteria.\nCreative solution: In response to the brief from \nSafeguard, the flagship soap brand of Procter & \nGamble, six Landor offices around the world col-\nlaborated to create an iconic, memorable identity \nthat would play a role in encouraging the adoption \nof a lifesaving behavior. The identity needed to be \nappealing and easily understood by adults and \nchildren in different cultures worldwide. It needed \nto be pictorial and not dependent on language, \nand it needed to work in a range of applications, \nmedia, and scales. Landor designed three friendly \nand appealing characters holding hands that com-\nmunicate that when water and hands are brought \ntogether with soap, health is the result—and \nhealth is worth smiling about. Landor developed \nidentity guidelines, sample applications, and envi-\nronmental standards that could be used by event \nplanners and future stakeholders in their myriad \nefforts to build awareness across various commu-\nnication channels. The firm also created multiple \npromotional materials for the inaugural event that \nincluded a planners guide for local teams in sixty \ncountries, figurines, and cause bracelets.\nResults: Global Handwashing Day has become \nthe centerpiece of a global campaign that has  \nmotivated over 200 million people in over one \nhundred countries. 2012 will mark its fourth year. It \nhas become a powerful platform for advocacy by  \npolicymakers and has inspired concrete public \ncommitment to actions that will spur public change \nand shift behavior.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The Good Housekeeping \nResearch Institute (GHRI) was formed before \nthere was an FDA and a Pure Food and Drug  \nAct. As an early proponent of consumer protec-\ntion, Good Housekeeping magazine created \ntesting labs to evaluate products for their readers. \nProducts advertised in the magazine that bear  \nthe seal are tested by GHRI and are backed by  \na two-­year limited warranty.\nTo celebrate the one hundredth anniversary, Good \nHousekeeping commissioned a new seal to be \ndrawn by Louise Fili Ltd. Director of Brand \nDevelopment Sara Rad wrote a brand brief, \nsearched through the archives to uncover the \nseal’s history, and organized a small team of deci-\nsion makers. There had been a total of eight  \ndifferent designs of the seal since 1909. “Good \nHousekeeping was seeking an update that would \nseamlessly combine its classic history with a  \nmodern type aesthetic. The goal was to design  \nthis one to last a long, long time.”\nCreative solution: The Seal’s many revisions \nhave always been a reflection of the style of the \ntimes. Right from the start, Louise Fili and the \ncommittee at Good Housekeeping knew they \nwanted the Seal to convey a timeless quality. \nAccording to Fili, “I wanted the Seal to look as \nthough it had always been there—classic but not \nretro. And in a style that exudes reassurance and \ntrust.” Having done design makeovers for many \ncompanies, she learned that a lot can be changed, \nas long as at least one element stays the same.  \nIn this case it was immediately apparent to her \nthat the oval needed to stay, as well as the star,  \nif possible. Fili also revisited the typeface in this \nmakeover, opting for Neutraface—a classic set  \nof letterforms based on the work of famed modern \narchitect Richard Neutra. The design process  \nalso took into consideration that the Seal would  \nbe reproduced in dramatically different scales  \nand media.\nResults: The new and improved Good House­\nkeeping Seal made its debut on the Today Show, \non a float at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, \nand on a billboard in Times Square, all in  \nthe same week. The magazine planned an entire \nyear of Seal-­related features for its 25 million \nreaders. To honor the Seal’s birthday, the doors  \nof GHRI in New York City were opened to the \npublic so consumers could see firsthand how \nGood Housekeeping evaluates everything from \nelectronics to vacuums to clothing on its state-­of-­\nthe-­art testing equipment.\nI wanted the seal to look as \nthough it had always been \nthere—classic but not retro.

Their mission was to inform \nparents about toxic substances in the environment \nthat could seriously harm their children. In 2005, \nwhen Christopher Gavigan became executive \ndirector, he realized that nonprofit’s name was \nunwieldy and the acronym CHEC caused a lot of \nconfusion. Michael Cronan and Karin Hibma, part-\nners in CRONAN, started to work with the \norganization to ask the big questions, to conduct \nextensive research, and to examine the identity. \nAfter interviewing the board and leadership teams, \nCronan and Hibma came back to CHEC with an \nextensive list of names to consider. They chal-\nlenged the decision makers to look at each name \nand ask, “Is it unique enough that we can own it? \nDoes it identify who we are? When people hear it, \ndoes it sound familiar (which is a good thing) and \nis it memorable?” And perhaps most importantly \nfor an organization that Cronan believed was on \nthe verge of launching a movement, “Is it a name \npeople can rally behind?”\nCreative solution: Hibma believes that the best \nnames facilitate storytelling. The new name, \nHealthy Child Healthy World, not only captures the \nessence of what was to become one of the most \ntrusted organizations advocating for children’s \nhealth, but it is easy to remember and differenti-\nated from most nonprofits. Most importantly, it \nclearly states the goal of everyone working for the \norganization. The visual identity that CRONAN \ndesigned had the lightness and joy that we see  \nin every happy child’s face. The freckle-faced  \ngirl in the identity is Colette. The logo is really a  \nportrait of the founders’ daughter. The new tagline  \nincorporated the old acronym­—CHEC became \nCreating Healthy Environments for Children, \nand builds on creating a cleaner, greener, and  \nsafer home.\nResults: The innovative philanthropist who com-\nmissioned CRONAN to do this work believes that \nthere was a high return on her investment. Within \nmonths following the rebranding, membership \nincreased over 200 percent, and the traffic to the \nrevitalized website increased 700 percent. The \nnew branding strategies have facilitated high-pro-\nfile partnerships that have exponentially grown \nawareness and funds raised, including WebMD, \nTarget, Seventh Generation, Stonyfield Farms, and \nmany other market leaders. “How much of this is \nattributable to the new identity? That’s hard to \nquantify,” says Gavigan, “but it’s at least fifty  \npercent. Now, whenever we go out to talk about \nthe organization, the new brand offers a clear  \nsense of what we value and the impact we focus  \non creating.” \nTo ignite a movement, we \ncreated a new name that is a \nsuccinct statement of the \ngoal—one everyone \nessentially understands.\nMichael Cronan\nPartner\nCRONAN\nThe biggest question about a \nname is whether or not it \ncommunicates the story. A \npowerful story needs a \npowerful name.\nKarin Hibma\nPartner\nCRONAN\n249\n",

Products from the 1950s are still in use \ntoday. Founder D. J. DePree required all new sites \nto be 50 percent green space, and in 1953 said, \n“Herman Miller shall be a good corporate steward \nof the environment.” In the late 1980s, a group of \nemployees pushed senior management to take a \nstrong position on the environment. In 1989, the \ngroup formed what became the Environmental \nQuality Action Team to formulate and monitor \nenvironmental policy. In 1993, Herman Miller col-\nlaborated with architects, engineers, developers, \nbuilders, product manufacturers, nonprofits, and \ngovernment agencies to cocreate the US Green \nBuilding Council to find ways to get people to \nbuild more sustainably. The group’s biggest contri-\nbution was setting up LEED (Leadership in \nEnergy and Environmental Design) standards, \ndesigned to boost green-building practices.\nCreative solution: Becoming a sustainable busi-\nness is intrinsic to Herman Miller’s spirit, value \nsystem, and heritage. This commitment is demon-\nstrated by its numerous green building facilities, its \ndesign process and products, its management’s \nbenchmarks, and environmental education. In \n2003, the Mirra was the first chair designed from \nthe ground up to meet Herman Miller’s stringent \nDesign for the Environment (DfE) protocols, which \nfocus on creating economic value while simultane-\nously valuing the environment. It is made of a \nminimal number of parts and is easily disassem-\nbled for recycling. The Embody chair is 96 percent \nrecyclable and PVC free. Herman Miller communi-\ncates regularly and across media about “Perfect \nVision,” a broad initiative that sets significant \nsustainability targets for the year 2020, including \nzero landfill, zero hazardous waste generation, 100 \npercent green electrical energy use, and 100 per-\ncent of sales from DfE-approved products. Even \nthe business cards are used to communicate the \nthings that matter most, from a better world to \ntransparency and sustainability goals.\nResults: The CEO’s scorecard includes environ-\nmental goals. As of 2012, Herman Miller has \nreduced its operational footprint by 88 percent \nand now uses 100 percent renewable electric \nenergy for operations worldwide. Its fuel-saving \ninitiatives have rolled up to more than 430,000 \ncar-miles avoided due to biking or carpooling and \nmore than $111,000 reimbursed to employees for \nthe purchase of bicycles or fuel-efficient vehicles. \nIn 2012, for the fourth consecutive year, Herman \nMiller received a perfect score on the Corporate \nEquality Index from the Human Rights Campaign.\nMirra, designed 2003\n251\n",

I hope that \nHigh Line will inspire \nothers to pursue their \nunlikely dreams.\nRobert Hammond\nCofounder\nFriends of the High Line\nProcess and strategy: In 1999, Robert \nHammond and Joshua David formed a group \ncalled Friends of the High Line to try to stop New \nYork City from tearing down an old industrial ele-\nvated railway structure on Manhattan’s west side. \nNeither of the two visionaries had any urban plan-\nning or park experience, but they shared an \naudacious idea of turning the High Line into a \nwildscape and a park. They wanted a logo, \nletterhead, and some business cards, so they \nwould look official. Paula Scher, Pentagram \npartner, quickly and intuitively envisioned the train \ntracks that make an H, and designed an iconic \nand simple symbol, and jump-started them with \nsome basics. What followed for the fledgling orga-\nnization was a decade of relationship building, \npublic forums, fundraising, legal battles, court chal-\nlenges, negotiations with elected officials and \nlandowners, exhibitions, and studies to analyze the \nphysical, social, and cultural and economic benefit \nto the city. A design competition ultimately \nattracted 720 teams from thirty-six countries.\nCreative solution: Throughout the decade prior \nto the park’s realization, Scher’s team designed an \nintegrated communications system that would \ngrow organically from the intelligence of the initial \nidea. The font family Avenir Next was chosen as \nthe core typeface, and the color green was used \nconsistently. In 2002, Pentagram designed \nReclaiming the High Line, a study of the project \npotential by the Design Trust for Public Space. The \ncover featured a photograph by Joel Sternfeld, \nwhose images of the abandoned rail line showed \nits extraordinary beauty and potential, and became \nan important element of the campaign to save the \nstructure. The identity system has consistently \nembodied the High Line’s vision. It has worked \nacross fundraising literature, event invitations, \ncampaign brochures, magazine designs, books, \npresentations, installations, and exhibits. After \nJames Corner Field Operations, a landscape archi-\ntecture firm, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, an \narchitecture firm, did the initial plans, Pentagram \ndesigned a wayfinding and signage system. The \nHigh Line opened in June 2009.\nResults: The High Line has become one of New \nYork City’s most visited destination and a model \nfor other urban projects around the world to repur-\npose industrial structures. The Friends of the High \nLine now provide over 90 percent of the High \nLine’s annual operating budget and are respon-\nsible for maintenance of the park, pursuant to a \nlicense agreement with the New York City \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation.

After three months of \nvigo­rous experimentation and ideation, IBM’s top \nmarketing, communications, and brand teams \ngathered alongside the agency teams to look at \nhundreds of sketches, and to form a vision for the \ncentennial identity. Ideas were deconstructed and \ndiscussed while new designs were generated. \nA rough collaged sketch that integrated Paul \nRand’s landmark 1972 8-­bar logo with a Selectric \ntypewriter sparked an epiphany: Why only one? \nWhat if we had a system of one hundred marks \nand the moments they celebrate? What if we \n paid homage to the ideas and innovations that \nhave shaped who we are? It would be called  \nIBM 100 Icons of Progress. A dedicated, thirty-­\nmember team was formed to oversee a cadre of \ndevelopers, designers, writers, content managers, \nproducers, editors, and subject matter experts.\nCreative solution: Each icon needed to be a \nunique vessel for meaning and storytelling. The \ncontent process began with a call for submissions \nto IBMers around the world: “We want to know \nabout the innovations, projects, and partnerships—\npast and present—that had led to transformative \nchange in local and regional markets, helping to \nmake the world work better.” While hundreds of \nsubmissions were being reviewed, VSA Partners \nled an exploration process to develop a cohesive \nand flexible design and content system. Each icon \nneeded to function as a visually arresting prompt \nfor a powerful idea, and was based on the number \none hundred. An exhaustive internal and external \nreview process of 860 stories was edited to one \nhundred iconic moments. A team of writers, edi-\ntors, and content managers conducted additional \nresearch and crafted the voice and tone of each \nstory. Design­ers drew inspiration from the IBM \narchives, third-­party materials, and both contempo-\nrary and historical art and culture. The design team \ncreated thousands of iterations in order to best \ncapture the iconic story behind each mark.\nResults: The Icons of Progress were launched in \nearly 2011 on IBM100.com and multiple other \nchannels throughout the year. The stories ignited \nconversations in 186 countries about the many \nways that IBM has transformed business, science, \nand society, from helping to put the first man  \non the moon to developing the bar code and the \npersonal computer.

    "chunk_full": "We see a world where \ncomputing moves from \nbeing about transactions \nto being about insight. In \nthat sense, IBM is in the \nbusiness of helping people \nuse information to think in \nnew ways.\nJon Iwata\nSVP, Marketing and \nCommunications\nIBM\nWhat was particular to IBM \nWatson was our team’s \naltruism. We could actually \nsee if we got it right, that it \nwould really spark people’s \nimagination about how \nIBM could really change \nthe world for the \nbetterment of humanity.\nDavid Korchin\nSenior Partner,  \nGroup Creative Director\nOgilvy & Mather Worldwide\nProcess and strategy: For a number of years, \nIBM scientists worked on a highly advanced com-\nputing system that could understand human \nlanguage. The research team believed that this \nsystem would be able to answer complex ques-\ntions with enough precision, confidence, and \nspeed to compete on Jeopardy!, an American TV \nquiz show. Since 80 percent of all the world’s new \ndata is stored in human language, IBM believed \nthat this scientific advancement had the potential \nto transform many industries, and solve some of \nthe world’s most critical problems. IBM challenged \nits agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, to stage \nthe event, to create the visual representation of \nthe technology, and to communicate to a global \naudience about the far-­reaching relevance and \nvalue of this complex computing system. While the \nresearch scientists worked on system intelligence, \nthe Ogilvy creative team pondered these ques-\ntions: What should it look like? How human should \nit be? How will it work on TV? What should we call \nit? VSA, a partner agency, suggested Watson, in \nhonor of IBM’s visionary president, Thomas J. \nWatson.\nCreative solution: The design process demon-\nstrated what happens when science meets art. \nThe challenge was to achieve the right balance \nbetween human emotional characteristics and dig-\nital data. After designing hundreds of visual \nconcepts, the Ogilvy creative team realized that \nthe avatar needed to visually connect to IBM \nSmarter Planet. Watson was clearly a part of the \nIBM agenda to contribute to a world that is instru-\nmented, interconnected, and intelligent. The \ncreative breakthrough was to develop an answer \npanel visible to the TV audience that would \nsomehow reveal Watson’s thinking process and \nconfidence level. Digital artist Joshua Davis devel-\noped a series of animated patterns that were \nbased on data generated by Watson while playing \nthe game. While the public face was being devel-\noped, the agency explained the science behind \nmore than two thousand computer processors \nworking in concert, and began to educate the \nworld about the possibilities of this technology.  \nA video series was developed that documented \nWatson’s journey through the eyes of the IBM \nresearchers led by principal investigator  \nDavid Ferrucci.\nResults: Although IBM Watson outperformed  \nits human opponents in its first public test on \nJeopardy! in February 2011, IBM views the real \ntest as applying the underlying systems, data  \nmanagement, and analytics technology across  \ndifferent industries, beginning with health care. \nIBM Watson attracted global media coverage,  \ngarnering over a billion impressions. A whole new \ndivision was subsequently formed to apply this \ntechnology, but the profound value was to the  \nIBM culture, inspiring IBM employees around the \nworld with a new sense of purpose and pride.\nThe avatar is programmed to \nreflect Watson’s thinking \nprocess.\nIBM: Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide\n257\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Europe is a continent  \nof fascinating destinations. Cities like Ieper need  \nto differentiate themselves in order to thrive and \nattract a younger population. As a scene of inten-\nsive fighting during World War I, the city’s image \nwas inextricably tied to the past and the Battle of \nYpres, which is the English name. An in-­depth \nmarketing and communication analysis was con-\nducted by the city. The result was a new plan that \nfocused on three priorities: tourism, the working \nand living environment, and the economic and \nsociocultural development of citizens and entre-\npreneurs. Lemento, a brand consultancy in \nAntwerp, Belgium, was engaged to create a com-\npelling and unique city image, and a brand promise \nthat reinforced these priorities. Instead of building \nan image solely around its rich history, Ieper \nneeded to become an international meeting point \nfor the past and the future. The brand promise cre-\nated by Lemento was “Everybody \nIeper”—everyone (young and old, citizens and \ntourists, families and companies) is welcome in \nIeper and can find something in this city they like.\nCreative solution: Inspired by the city’s versatility \nand informed by a competitive analysis, Lemento \ndeveloped an authentic, future-­facing brand that \npays homage to the past but welcomes the future. \nThe visual concept design is based on the bold \nRoman numeral I, referring both to World War I \nand to the first letter of the city’s name in Dutch \n(Ieper). The “I” also represents the characteristics \nof the Belgian city: intriguing, inspiring, interna-\ntional, intensive, intimate, inno­vating, and \ninteresting. The simple and iconic shape was \ndesigned to work well at large and small scales, \nincluding signage, information booths, vehicles, \nbanners, and benches. The identity is designed to \nbe part of the everyday experience. In addition, the \nIeper brand architecture is a consistent, monolithic \nentity, creating a unified family of city services \nworking together. Every city service has its own \nname, juxtaposed to the master brand.\nResults: Numerous events were organized to \nmake the new brand promise understandable and \nthe new identity visible. After a decade of popula-\ntion decline, the numbers of inhabitants and \nvisitors have increased. The number of enterprises  \nin Ieper has grown 3.5 percent in the three years \nfollowing the launch of the new plan and posi-\ntioning. Along with high-visibility signage and \nbanners, the city’s internal agencies are actively \nusing the guidelines in the city magazine, event \nposters, and marketing literature.\nIeper: Lemento\n259\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The idea of transforming \na heavy backpack into the interactive textbook of \nthe future came to founder Matt MacInnis in his \nliving room. Initially called Standard Nine, the start-\nup needed a permanent name for its first product \nlaunch. A Hundred Monkeys, a naming boutique, \nwas engaged to lead the small team through a \ndisciplined naming process. Danny Altman, \nfounder and CEO, began with in-depth interviews \nof the core team, then returned each week with a \nnew set of names. The multilingual, decision-\nmaking team worked collaboratively to hone down \nthe possibilities. “There’s a big difference between \neducation and learning. We wanted to find a name \nthat captured what it’s like to learn when you’re \ndriving the process from your own curiosity,” said \nAltman. Early in the naming process, MacInnis \nretained MetaDesign, a branding firm, to start envi-\nsioning the brand and its positioning. After a small \nset of names was agreed upon, trademark and \ndomain availability research began. \nCreative solution: From the beginning of the pro-\ncess, MacInnis understood the strategy and \nnuances of naming. “We very much believed that \nthe word we chose would be an empty vessel that \nwe would fill. There is no ultimate right decision,” \nsaid MacInnis, a marketer and former Apple \nemployee. Curiosity was the central idea, and \nInkling was the agreed upon word that was easy \nto remember and great to say, and that communi-\ncated anticipation of the future. MetaDesign \nconducted a far-reaching exploration into the \nbrand aspirations, values, and positioning that \nwould change the way an entire generation learns. \n“The new identity reflects revelation and the \npremise that as we attempt to learn something, \nmuch of the information remains concealed at \nfirst, enticing us to look deeper to discover it,” said \nAlexander Haldemann, CEO of MetaDesign. The \nnew identity was designed to work in both online \nand offline environments.\nResults: The New York Times named Inkling the \nfront-runner in the tablet-textbook market. Inkling \nreceived numerous positive media reviews, from \nBloomberg Business to Fortune. MacWorld named \nInkling one of the best products of 2011, based on \nquality, utility, innovation, value, and excellence. By \nspring 2012, Inkling was selling more than one \nhundred textbooks, including titles like Basic \nBusiness Statistics and The Professional Chef. In \n2012, MacInnis introduced Inkling Habitat, the \nworld’s first scalable publishing environment for \nbuilding interactive content, and he is expanding \nplatforms beyond the iPad.\nTrue to the company’s brand \npromise, the design evokes a \nsense of awakening curiosity \nand wonder.⁜\nAlexander Haldemann⁜\nCEO⁜\nMetaDesign\nInkling: Meta Design\n261\n",

Its \nacquisition of York in 2005 helped the company \nbuild its diversified revenue base and strong repu-\ntation for optimizing building efficiency. \nRepositioning the corporate brand would support \na higher valuation. Ready to broaden market per-\nceptions about its capabilities, Johnson Controls \nengaged Lippincott to leverage the company’s \nmarket leadership and fuel future growth. The ini-\ntial phase of work focused on a qualitative \nassessment of brand strengths and challenges. \nLippincott conducted an extensive global brand \nassessment to determine key market needs, \nimage drivers, and high-potential growth areas. \nThe findings were then translated into a unique \ncorporate positioning strategy that builds on \nJohnson Controls’ ability to create appealing envi-\nronments for customers across many areas of \ntheir lives—homes, cars, and offices. The posi-\ntioning was then converted into a brand promise \nto engage employees to “live the brand.”\nCreative solution: After the new positioning \nstrategy and brand assessments were complete, \nLippincott redesigned an entire global visual iden-\ntity system, from the website and marketing \nliterature to vehicles and signage. The new system \npositioned Johnson Controls as a forward-thinking \nenterprise that is commercializing innovation glob-\nally at an accelerated pace. A new symbol was \ndesigned and named “the open globe.” A new \nmessaging platform was developed and applied to \nnew sales presentations and product literature. \nLippincott recommended a more efficient master \nbrand model and a plan for brand transition, \nincluding a new communications and advertising \nvendor. Detailed brand guidelines were developed \nto bring the recommendations to life. The company \ngenerated momentum for the introduction of the \nnew brand strategy through the design of an inter-\nactive online brand center for employees and \nexternal agencies.\nResults: Johnson Controls believes that building \nits brand will enable it to better compete for  \nthe best talent in all of its geographic markets and \nsupport continued growth and market share.  \nIt has consistently outperformed its underlying \nindustries.

In the \n1930s, the company opened up a whole new \nmarket by repositioning it as a disposable hand-\nkerchief. Today, Kleenex brand box is omnipresent \nin homes and offices in more than 150 countries. \nAlthough the Kleenex brand has maintained its \nposition as the number one facial tissue in the \nworld, increased global competition has necessi-\ntated marketing intelligence and innovation. \nHistoric packaging innovations like the upright \ncube box, the travel pack, and color illustration \nenlivened the category, but the Kleenex brand \nneeded a new breakthrough to create consumer \npreference. Christine Mau, brand design director in \nthe Kimberly-Clark Global Design group, led by \nDayton Henderson, worked with a multidisciplinary \nteam of market researchers, engineers, designers, \nand branding experts, to answer the question, \n“How do we leverage the power of strategic \ndesign against business objectives to grow this \nbrand?” The team embarked on a process to rein-\nvent a product category that had become \npredicable and taken for granted.\nCreative solution: Mau has led a series of design \ninnovations to build the Kleenex brand by exam-\nining core identity, positioning, packaging, product \ndevelopment, and aesthetics. The logotype was \nredesigned to reflect the brand’s \nfriendly positioning. Consumer insights and trend \nforecasting were leveraged to radically rethink the \ncategory. Although changing structure required \nenormous engineering production and engineering \ninvestments, the teams began the process to liter-\nally “think outside the box.” In 2006, the \nrevolutionary oval was launched. In 2009, the \n“slices of summer” wedge boxes were launched. \nThe on-the-go category was reinvented next: auto \npacks were designed to fit in the door pocket or to \nbe wedged between the seats or visor. Wallet \npacks were designed to be slim, stylish, and easy \nto toss into a backpack or back pocket. In 2012, \nthe Kleenex brand formed strategic partnerships \nwith Disney, Shutterfly, and Major League Baseball \nand offered consumers the opportunity to express \nthemselves by customizing Kleenex brand ovals \non mykleenextissue.com with different back-\ngrounds, photos, clip art, and text. \nResults: Kleenex brand has revitalized a brand \ncategory with design thinking, resulting in \nincreased revenues and market share. New mer-\nchandising opportunities have been created and \nthe brand has become relevant to Gen Yers. \nChallenging convention, understanding sales \ncycles as well as the lives and lifestyles of con-\nsumers, and building a business case for \ninnovation were all critical success factors in \ndriving Kleenex brand’s continuous innovation.\nWe’re reaching new \nconsumers in a way that we \nhaven’t been able to before.\nJim Schuh\nDigital Marketing Manager\nKimberly-Clark\n265\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: After quitting their jobs  \nas diamond cutters in New York City, Francesco \nRealmuto and Salvatore Potestio searched for the \nbest gelato artisans in Italy. In 2009, they opened \nL’Arte del Gelato, their first gelateria, in Chelsea \nMarket. Unlike their competitors’ product, this \ngelato is made fresh every day, with the best \ningredients: the freshest fruit, pistachios from \nSicily’s Bronte region, and coffee beans from \nArgentina. Their identity, however, reflected neither \ntheir vision nor anything artisanal or Italian. They \nwere introduced to Louise Fili, a designer who \nloves food and all things Italian. When she was in \nFlorence researching her book, The Civilized \nShopper’s Guide to Florence, she taste-­tested \ngelato at least twice a day. Fili’s design process \nbegan with an in-­depth interview, to fully under-\nstand her clients’ vision. Her family came from \nSicily, and conversations about design, gelato, and \nlife were all in Italian. Fili was taken with the supe-\nriority of the gelato, and proceeded to sketch \nseveral ideas.\nCreative solution: When Fili thought about gelato \nand Italy in general, she conjured up that won-\nderful, carefree nostalgia of early black-­and-­white \nfilms starring Vittorio De Sica. She wanted the new \nidentity to reference that romanticism, as well as \nthe authenticity of the product. Many years ago, on \na trip to Italy, Fili discovered Italian pastry papers \nfrom the 1930s. These lighthearted, decorative \npapers inspired her to focus her career on food \npackaging and restaurants. She showed the \npapers to Realmuto, who agreed that they \nembodied a look and feel that was right for L’Arte \ndel Gelato. The distinctive triangular shape Fili \ndesigned then became a vessel for her hand-­\ndrawn typography. The Italian words fresco ogni \ngiorno were designed as part of the mark to com-\nmunicate “made fresh every day.” The color palette \nwas inspired by strawberry gelato and passion fruit \nsorbetto, and conveyed happiness, true to the \nexperience. Fili also redesigned the website, which \ncan be read in either Italian or English.\nResults: The new identity helped L’Arte del Gelato \nattract new customers and garner coveted media \nattention. During the warmer months, the gelato  \nis sold around the city in carts imported from  \nItaly. In the summer of 2011, L’Arte del Gelato \nwas awarded one of five coveted spots for arti-\nsanal/gourmet food carts on the High Line.  \nThe newest publicity coup is a 1971 Fiat \nCinquecento (shipped over from Sicily) driven \naround the city by Realmuto. Like his gelato, it \nmakes everyone smile.\nWhen we speak about design \nand gelato, we converse in \nItalian.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Through its twenty-six \nhistoric sites and museums, the Minnesota \nHistorical Society (MHS) has offered a wide range \nof thought-­provoking education and entertainment \nexperiences across urban and rural territories.  \nLory Sutton, Chief Marketing Officer, wanted to \nachieve marketing synergy for the twenty-six sub-­\nbrands and identify a more intentional connection \nto the MHS master brand. Little & Company was \nengaged to examine brand architecture and its \nimpact on marketing, new campaigns, and exhibits. \nFrom the beginning, the process was collaborative \nand engaged all of the sites, exhibits, and mar-\nketing teams. Little used three methods to gather \ninsights: interviews with site managers and exhibit \ndevelopers; on-­site visits, visitor observation, and \ncasual intercepts (that is, no formal questionnaire); \nand a review of annual visitor and member sur-\nveys. After the discovery phase, the strategy phase \nfocused on clarifying positioning and personality. \nRegardless of the site, the twenty-six sub-­brands \nneeded an umbrella strategy to increase traffic \nand a way to leverage a deeper affinity for the \nmaster brand.\nCreative solution: Over the course of seven \nyears, Little worked with the Society to become a \nconsumer-­centric marketer, raising its influence as \nthe one brand keeper for all of its site affiliations. \nTraditionally, the Society had employed a mar-\nketing strategy that distributed funds equitably \nacross all twenty-six historic sites and museums, \nseverely limiting the resources dedi­cated to the \ntop attractions. However, in 2003, the Society’s \nbrand architecture was reenvisioned and all mar-\nketing initiatives became part of a tiered system \nthat prioritized funds toward the top attractions. \nThis shift laid the groundwork for Little to create \nan authentic, site-­specific brand identity for top \nattractions Split Rock Lighthouse, Mill City \nMuseum, and Historic Fort Snelling. Campaigns \nwould now incorporate fresh and bold visual lan-\nguage, an audience-­friendly marketing tone, and a \nconsistent voice. The campaign art conveyed new \nexcitement and personality, and was used across \nmarketing channels, from the website through \nenvironmental graphics.\nResults: The new, more focused brand strategy \nhas allowed the Society to funnel its marketing \nbudget toward the top-­tier sites that feature the \nmost exceptional visitor experiences. Based on  \nthe philosophy that “a rising tide lifts all boats,” \nthese then became hubs for promoting the other \nsites around the state. The effectiveness of that \nstrategy, and the efficiencies it created, was a  \ncornerstone of the tiered-­site approach, which  \nhas achieved dramatic double-­digit increases at \ntargeted sites, and an overall increase statewide.\nAs caretakers of the \nMinnesota Historical Society \nbrand, we helped thread \ntogether existing equities  \nthat allowed the organization \nto speak as a stronger, \nsingular entity.\nJoseph Cecere\nPresident and Chief Creative Officer\nLittle & Company\nMinnesota Historical Society: Little & Company\n271\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: MoMA has one of the \nmost recognizable logotypes in the museum world. \nOriginally designed by Ivan Chermayeff in 1964, \nthe Franklin Gothic No. 2 logotype was redrawn in \na new custom typeface named MoMA Gothic by \nMatthew Carter in 2004. Although the core iden-\ntity itself is bold and iconic, the overall application \nacross web, print, and the physical environment \nhas not been cohesive or visionary like the \nmuseum itself. The marketing advisory committee \nof the museum identified revitalizing the communi-\ncations system as a priority. The museum engaged \nPenta­gram to design a more powerful and inte-\ngrated comprehensive system. “While the MoMA \nlogo is iconic, it alone is not enough to continually \ncarry the spirit of the institution,” said Paula Scher, \npartner and lead designer for the project.\nCreative solution: To create an attitude that \nmodernizes the institution’s image, Scher designed \na complete methodology for the new system that \nworks at any scale, from an exterior banner to a \nprint advertisement in the newspaper. A strong \ngrid was designed for the uniform placement of \nimages and type. Each quadrant of a page or a \nbanner has a specific function. And for the first \ntime in the museum’s history, artwork is being \ncropped to maximize visual impact and marketing. \nA bold, singular image is selected as the signature \nfocus of an exhibit, and is visually accompanied by \na text block that features upcoming events. The \nlogotype, always black on white, is used vertically \nwhen possible, and always bleeds off an edge. \nMoMA Gothic is the primary font for all typography \nin all applications. The system is very flexible. On  \napplications like banners and billboards, type and \nimages are used in multiples, creating a dynamic \npattern against the urban landscape.\nResults: The new system is being used for \nMoMA’s institutional and public communications, \nincluding brochures, banners, the website, and \nother materials. Individual exhibitions will continue \nto have their own identities, used in catalogues, \nwebsites, and exhibition graphics. Julia Hoffmann, \ncreative director of advertising and graphic design \nat MoMA, and her internal team have brought the \nsystem to life in applications from large banners \nand subway posters to the website. MoMA at long \nlast has an identity system that carries the spirit of  \nits iconic institution.\nThis project is one of a series \nof innovative initiatives \nconceived by a new marketing \nadvisory committee established \nby MoMA in January 2008. \nThe committee, composed of \nlocal advertising and design \nprofessionals, advises the \nmuseum on new avenues of \ncommunication and ways to \ndiversify and engage with its \naudience.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Soon after Alan Becker, \nNizuc’s developer, purchased the twenty-eight-­\nacre estate of the former Mexican president,  \nhe began a search for a hotel operator. He  \ninterviewed a number of international upscale \nhotel management companies who were more \ninterested in extending their brand equity  \nthan developing a vision for his site’s unique  \nattributes. “We wanted to be Mayan without  \nbeing thematic,” he says. Becker envisioned the \narchitecture to reflect the culture and heritage of \nthe Mayan civilization.\nBecker brought in Carbone Smolan Agency (CSA) \nto create a unique brand platform to establish the \ncore ideas from which all other decisions and part-\nnerships would emanate. Becker and CSA  \ncollaborated over the next nine months to under-\nstand conceptually and visually what the soul of \nthis new ultra-luxury destination would feel like \nand look like. The theme was “Mayan culture \nbrought into the twenty-first century.” This \nbranding-­first approach was considered a radical \ndeparture in the hotel industry.\nCreative solution: The luxury destination exists \non a peninsula, Punta Nizuc, which inspired the \nname. CSA began the creative process by \ndesigning a modern Mayan glyph as the \nbrandmark. The iconic, strong form lent itself to \ncreating beautiful patterns and facilitated the  \ndesign of objects of desire, from amulets to soaps \nand cookies. The second phase of the process \nwas about creating images that captured the soul \nand experience of a destination that was not yet \nbuilt. Led by design director Carla Miller, the cre-\native team packed twenty-two boxes of props and \nflew down to Mexico with a staff of designers, styl-\nists, models, and photographer Quentin Bacon. \nSeven eighteen-­hour days created a series of \nimages that celebrated beauty, magic, design, \nhigh-­end luxury, and otherworld­liness. These \nimages were then designed into a brand book that \nilluminated the essence of the destination.\nResults: The Nizuc branding process channeled \nthe vision of the developer, who brought in archi-\ntect Jean-Michel Gathy and Indonesian interior \ndesigner Jaya Ibrahim. Amid the destruction of the \nfinancial markets, Becker’s vision was put on hold. \nBut Nizuc lived. Five years later, a new developer, \nLas Brisas Hotels, heard the story of Nizuc and \nbought the land and the brand. Establishing a \nbrand platform and a branding-first approach \nworked from an investment perspective as well as \na marketing perspective. \nDesign was at the heart of \nour process. We needed to \ncreate a place before there \nwas a place. We needed to \ncapture the experience of \nNizuc.\nLeslie Smolan\nCofounder and  \nDirector of Creative Strategy\nCarbone Smolan Agency\n275\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: NO MORE was created \nby fifty individuals from the private and public sec-\ntors who were frustrated by the fact that even \nthough domestic violence and sexual assault (DV/\nSA) are devastatingly pervasive—impacting rich, \npoor, young, old, male and female from every race, \nregion, and religion—the problem is not a priority \nin this country. These issues are underfunded with \nshame and stigma still surrounding them.\nTo address this, Anne Glauber, Virginia Witt, Maile \nZambuto, and Jane Randel led an effort to \nincrease visibility and better connect the public to \nthese issues. The question: How could we support \nsurvivors, show perpetrators that their crimes won’t \nbe tolerated, and demonstrate broad concern to \npublic officials? First they reached out to every \nmajor US DV/SA organization to share this bold \nstrategy that would help individuals, organizations, \nand national brands take action. Then they held \nnumerous exploratory meetings to build con-\nsensus and strategic alliances. Ultimately, all \nagreed that a universal symbol, widely visible \nacross platforms, could galvanize support, gen-\nerate funding, and increase awareness. \nCreative solution: The founders started by  \norganizing think tanks made up of leading  \nbranding and marketing experts who had never  \nconsidered these issues before. These creative \nvisioning sessions produced what ultimately \nbecame “NO MORE”—a symbol that expresses \nthe universal and collective emotion and impera-\ntive. Debbie Millman, President of the Design \nGroup at Sterling Brands, and Christine Mau, \nBrand Design Director, Kimberly-Clark, led the \ndesign process. Like the peace sign, the red AIDS \nribbon, or the pink breast cancer ribbon, the NO \nMORE symbol will be used by the public, \ninfluencers, and DV/SA organizations to move \nthese issues higher on the public’s agenda. As \nsuch, it has to work across platforms—from a \nTwitter page on a mobile device to a T-shirt. A \nthree-year launch plan calls for celebrities, \ninfluencers, and everyday people to wear the \nsymbol to express their commitment and inspire \naction. National brands and strategic alliances will \ndemonstrate their support through a variety of co-\nbranding platforms.\nResults: In early 2012, NO MORE conducted a \nsoft launch to 250 legislators, advocates, and pro-\nfessionals. In just four months, nomore.org has \nreceived more than 32,000 views, 300 photo sub-\nmissions, and 600 inquiries from advocates \nworldwide who want to help. Toolkits with logos, \nposters, handouts, social media posts, and presen-\ntations in English and Spanish were made \navailable. A media blitz in late 2012 will leverage \nsocial networks, print, broadcast, online PSAs, \nmerchandise, and high-publicity events to gen-\nerate support. A partnership with a NASCAR team \nhas been highly effective. \nNO MORE: Sterling Brands\n277\n",

A multi-­team task force was formed with \nPNC Realty Services and National City’s Facilities \nManagement team members. PNC engaged \nMonigle Associates, a national brand conversion \nconsulting company, to provide expertise and \nassist in managing the day-­to-­day tactical project \nrollout. The project demanded strict adherence to \nthe defined conversion schedule, the highest \nquality of product and installation standards, and \ncontrol of the project’s costs. An overarching goal \nwas adherence to PNC’s core values: first, to \nmaintain customer relationships with PNC and \nNCC customers and second, to hold true to PNC’s \n“green” values. The project started with a sixteen-­\nweek supplier evaluation to examine production \nand installation capabilities. Monigle Associates’ \nproject management software, SignCHART, \nhoused specifications and tracked milestones and \nmetrics critical to managing multiple contractors \nthrough the complex conversion process.\nCreative solution: Although PNC’s standard  \nfamily of signs had been previously established, \nimprovements were made to increase energy  \nefficiency and branding needs. Once facility  \ndesign recommendations were approved by the \nSign Conversion Team, all of the sign recommen-\ndation packages were personally delivered to the \nindividual Retail Market Managers for their final \nreview. After the branding was approved, sign \npackages for leased sites were sent by the  \nPNC Leasing Group to landlords for review and \napproval. Some high-­visibility sites underwent \ncomplex variance process hearings with zoning \nand architectural review boards. Beyond the direct \nsavings achieved from lower-­cost manufacturing \nand installation, ongoing expenses were reduced \nthrough the analysis and implementation of a  \nnew LED illuminated package of signs. Power \nconsumption of an average wall sign was reduced \nby 62 percent without sacrificing quality and \nrequired less effort to maintain. Fifty percent of \nthe suppliers who were awarded business had \nstrong relationships with the bank, and minority \nsuppliers represented almost 25 percent of the \nworkforce, which had a positive impact on the \ndiversity of PNC’s supplier portfolio.\nResults: The entire conversion took seventy-six \nweeks from kickoff to completion. A check system \nverified that all markets in each phase were \npleased with the sign conversion results. PNC and \nNCC employees utilized an internal news network \nto talk about the quality and speed of the project, \nwhich coincided with the phased rollout of \nbranding. The Strategic Sourcing Team’s multi-\nmedia presentations focused on the savings and \ndiversity impact. The Sign Conversion Team \nreceived numerous accolades from executive \nmanagement regarding how well the sign  \nconversion project was planned, communicated, \nand executed.\nOur goal was to improve the \nbranding and visibility at \nevery National City location, \nwhile meeting tight \ntimeframes and managing \ncosts.\nKurt Monigle\nPrincipal\nMonigle Associates\nPNC Bank: Monigle Associates\n283\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Harnessing the private \nsector and partnering with successful global \nbrands to eliminate AIDS in Africa was the big \nidea conceived by Bono and Bobby Shriver. Bono \ncalls it “conscious consumerism.” Their new busi-\nness model had three overarching principles:  \ndeliver a source of sustainable private sector  \nincome to the Global Fund, the acknowledged \nleader and expert in financing the fight against \nAIDS; provide consumers with a choice that made \ngiving effortless at no extra cost; and generate \nprofits and a sense of purpose for partner compa-\nnies. Brand partners pay a licensing fee for use of \nthe (RED) brand, which they then use to manage \nand market their (RED) products. The fee does \nnot infringe on the amount of money sent to the \nGlobal Fund. Wolff Olins was engaged to work \nwith Bobby Shriver and his team to paint a vision \nof the new brand and develop a strategy to attract \nfounding partners, and to create a unique brand \nexpression that allows (RED) to interface with \niconic brands in a way that allows them to be \nthemselves, but also to be (RED).\nCreative solution: Wolff Olins built the brand \naround the idea that (RED) inspires, connects, and \ngives consumers power. The design team needed \nto create a brand architecture that showcases the \nparticipating brand and, at the same time, links \nthat brand to the power of (RED). The identity \nsystem needed to be immediately recognizable \nand work across media, in marketing and on \nproduct. Although making the products the color \nred was not a requirement, many of the partici-\npating businesses extended the idea of (RED) to \nthe product. Apple created red iPod Shuffles and \niPod Nanos. In the UK, there is a (RED) American \nExpress card that gives money to the Global Fund \neach time a consumer makes a purchase. All bear \nthe (product/brand) RED lockup.\nResults: Within weeks of the US launch, the \n(RED) brand registered 30 percent unaided \nawareness. (RED) is now a real phenomenon, with \nover1.3 million fans on Facebook. Since its launch \nin 2006, (RED) has generated over $170 million  \nfor the Global Fund, which is more than most  \nindividual countries donated in the same period.  \nTo date, (RED) has saved over 7 million lives.\nTwo-thirds of people  \naffected with AIDS  \nin Africa are women  \nand children.\n285\n",

Rezende\nDirector\nCauduro Associates\nProcess and strategy: Initially, Santos Brasil  \nengaged Cauduro Associates to change the name \nof its public company. The process began with the \nsenior management team reaffirming its vision for \nthe future: to be the best port infrastructure and \nintegrated logistics service company in the mar-\nkets in which it operates. Santos Brasil wanted to \nbe perceived as friendly and socially and environ-\nmentally responsible. The company wanted to be \npositioned as global, because its terminals had  \nthe operational efficiency of the world’s leading \nport terminals. Research studies revealed that \nthere was overall low awareness and brand visi-\nbility within the investment community. Cauduro’s \nanalysis and insights determined that the name \nSantos Brasil appealed to audiences around the \nworld. Santos, the largest port in Brasil, is relevant \nto the industry category, as well as a concrete  \nexpression of the company’s concern about its \ncommunities and commitment to sustainable  \ndevelopment. The total brand would be built \naround the idea of responsible leadership.\nCreative solution: Cauduro began by creating a \nmonolithic brand architecture that would become \nthe framework for positioning the public company \nas a market leader. Both the logistics and con-\ntainer management companies would be \norganized under the Santos Brasil master brand. \nNaming was streamlined and unified across busi-\nness units, so that future acquisitions would be  \nfacilitated. The new Santos Brasil symbol was \ndesigned to synthesize economic and symbolic \nvalue. The S design is a translation of Santos port \ngeog­raphy. The colors came from a logical choice: \nblue for the sea and green for nature. A master \nplan was developed to make the new brand iden-\ntity system very visible in all the port terminals and \non investment and internal communications.\nResults: Santos Brasil’s new brand symbolizes  \nits commitment to business excellence and con­\ntinu­ous improvement and to generating value for \nshareholders, clients, suppliers, employees, local \ncommunities, and society. It has engendered pride \nin the workforce, creating a sense of unity \nbetween the business units. Brand awareness has \nincreased in the investment community and in the \ncountry as well. In 2011, Santos Brasil was listed \nas the market leader in its category. The new \nbrand identity is visible on every piece of equip-\nment and can be seen across all of its port \nterminals and facilities.\nSantos Brasil: Cauduro Associates\n287\n",

VSA Partners was engaged to articulate \nthe enduring relationship between American craft \nand mass production, and to help Schoolhouse  \ntell a better story with different messages across \nnew channels. VSA began by doing research \n on logical product extensions beyond lighting,  \nidentifying synergies with urban/craft/heritage \ndesign enthusiasts. VSA’s Andy Gray and  \nTravis Barteaux worked closely with the founder \nand the director of lighting, marketing, and \n digital Michelle Steinback, to clearly define, what \nis the Schoolhouse Electric of furniture and \nhousewares, and what isn’t? It became clear to the \nteam that the name should evolve to Schoolhouse \nElectric & Supply Co.— retaining the equity of \n“Schoolhouse Electric” but reflecting a newly \nexpanded range of goods.\nCreative solution: VSA and Schoolhouse worked \ntogether for over a year on product inspiration, \nidentity design, catalogue concept and design, art \ndirection of photography, and website redesign. \n“We always imagined the identity as a series of \nlogos, which should feel as if they had evolved \nover time, like an unwritten history. Their usage \nwould be guided by application and context,” said \nGray. VSA used a fluid design process to help \nshape the brand persona. They did not specify \nrules until after the packaging and collateral had \nbeen explored. VSA also developed an approach \nto photographing classic products in a relevant \nand modern way, demonstrating a uniquely \nAmerican mindset and aesthetic. VSA wrote and \ndesigned a brand book articulating the unifying \ndesign principles, voice, and values that define \nSchoolhouse. In fall 2011, Schoolhouse was ready \nto launch 150 new lifestyle products, seventy-five \nnew hardware items, and fifty new lighting items.\nResults: Schoolhouse opened a new flagship \nstore and launched the new branding and website \nall on the same day. News spread quickly to a \nlarge audience of bloggers and design enthusi-\nasts, including Design*Sponge, Remodelista, and \nA Continuous Lean. Leading magazine editors \npicked up the story in publications including \nMonocle and Men’s Journal. Eighty thousand beau-\ntiful catalogues were mailed, email blasts were \nsent out, and Schoolhouse posted a professionally \nproduced video on Vimeo.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Andy Sernovitz created \nthe Blog Council, later renamed the Social Media \nBusiness Council (SMBC), to create a safe envi-\nronment for social media decision makers at big \nbrands to share actionable ideas, best practices, \nand critical insights. Originally a sub-brand of \nGasPedal, the council grew and needed to be a \nstand-alone brand with its own website. There was \nsubstantial brand confusion, the acronym SMBC \nwas messy, and the name was hard to say. The \nname was changed to the more concise and \nmemorable SocialMedia.org. The organization also \nneeded a flexible system that would allow expan-\nsion into several councils, while maintaining \nequality among them. Matchstic was engaged to \ndesign a brand identity system and a new brand \narchitecture that would facilitate growth. After \ninterviewing the founder and conducting mar-\nketing and competitive audits, Matchstic attended \nBlogWell, a SocialMedia.org best practices confer-\nence, to interview existing members, nonmembers, \nand staff to gather insights. “People Like You” was \nthe positioning strategy Matchstic developed to \nunderscore that this was a brand-only community, \nfree of agencies and vendors, with a family of \n“people with the same jobs as you, facing the \nsame challenge as you.”\nCreative solution: Matchstic designed an \napproach called “the dot”—a circle that is the \nvessel for both the name and the newly acquired \ndomain. The brand mark serves as a signal of the \nbrand ideals of community, neutrality, and trust. \nMatchstic designed an identity system that reflects \nthe personality and communication style of the \norganization. Everything from the look and feel to \nthe voice is very straightforward yet personable. \nWhen a member joins, the company is assigned to \nan eighty-company council, which consists of 500 \nsocial media leaders selected from a wide range \nof industries. The brand architecture distinguishes \neach council with a color, such as the “Blue \nCouncil.” This conveys that they are all equal and \nthere is no preference or hierarchy. The “dot” is \nblack because black is a combination of all colors.\nResults: Since Socialmedia.org launched the new \nbrand, it has grown from 140 members to 214 and \nis preparing to launch its fourth council. Sernovitz \nsummarizes the results of the rebranding: “We’ve \nseen a substantial increase in credibility due to the \nnew brand. We now have the mature look that sig-\nnals that this is a substantial group with impact \nand longevity. Current members are more proud to \nshow their affiliation, and  \npotential members are much more responsive to \n our approach.”\nThis is one of the few forums \nwhere I have seen competitors \nwork together to help each \nother out.\nDan Phelps\nManager of Critical and  \nEmerging Communications\nT.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Spectrum Health was \nformed in 1997 by the merger of two competing \nGrand Rapids hospitals, followed by the acquisi-\ntion of seven additional hospitals and over 190 \nservice sites. Historically, names of entities were \nretained or altered slightly as they joined Spectrum \nHealth. Medical professionals and people in the \ncommunity continued to refer to entities by their \nold, familiar names. Like many rapidly growing \norganizations, Spectrum quickly outgrew its orig-\ninal visual identity and nomenclature structure. \nManagement recognized the need for a sophisti-\ncated and consistent system of identity and \nnomenclature to define and describe the organiza-\ntion, and to serve it through future decades of \nexpansion. In 2008, Crosby Associates began \nworking with the organization to develop a new \nvisual identity and an integrated branding program. \nThe process began with establishing a hierarchy \nof branded entities from administrative and organi-\nzational units, to departments and divisions, to \ncenters and institutes. Standards were also estab-\nlished for naming new acquisitions and alliances.\nCreative solution: Crosby designed a dynamic \nsymbol for the master brand that connotes energy \nand forward movement, and represents Spectrum \nHealth’s many components, services, and loca-\ntions. Along with a positioning strategy, the firm \ndeveloped a comprehensive system for \nsub-brands, typography, color, and formatting. \nStandards were developed for every structure and \nitem that represented the health system, including \nsignage, vehicles, stationery, print and electronic \ncommunications, gifts and gear, food service, uni-\nforms, and Microsoft Word-based templates for all \nsystem documents. Standards were then incorpo-\nrated into a password-protected website that can \nbe accessed by all internal communications teams \nand external vendors. All of these standards are \nnow integrated into the system’s official policies \nand procedures manual. After completing the \nstandards, Crosby continued to provide ongoing \nbrand consultation and supervision of the work of \noutside design firms and vendors.\nResults: Spectrum Health’s brand has contributed \nto its ability to attract top quality physicians and \nother health care professionals, and to be a \nleading choice for health care services providers in \nsearch of a merger partner. The visual identity and \nnomenclature standards facilitate a smooth inte-\ngration of acquired organizations. In 2011 and \n2010, Spectrum Health was named one of the \nnation’s top ten health systems by Thomson \nReuters. Spectrum Health continues to be the \nregion’s largest health care provider and West \nMichigan’s largest employer.\n295\n",

She believed in \nthe power of an integrated, collaborative creative \nteam to design a concept that takes shape in the \nprocess without a preconceived outcome. \nWilloughby was engaged to design the identity, \nenvironmental trade dress, packaging, and mer-\nchandise design; Tracy Stearns of 360 \nArchitecture was engaged to design the space. \nThe name SPIN! was inspired by the hand-­tossing \nof the pizza dough and Lozoff’s other passion, \nItalian bike racing.\nCreative solution: Everything about the SPIN! \nguest experience was designed to feel sponta-\nneous and unpredictable. Willoughby’s spin man \nlogo rides a bike while spinning a pizza. Every \naspect of the customer experience was designed \nto deliver a delightful, unforgettable brand experi-\nence. Details like the china, tableware, bike \nsprocket lights, and table surfaces were all consid-\nered and researched until the perfect object was \nfound. The team built models and designed the \ncustomer experience in numerous iterations \nending with full-­size prototypes of specific \nencounters in the guest journey. The large plates, \nfor example, are expensive, handmade ceramic \npottery but they are paired with typical restaurant \nutensils. The large-­scale identity graphics are \nmade of layered letterpress images of Italian bike \nraces and can be configured in a variety of ways \nso that each environment is a bit different. The \ngraphics are applied to unusual surfaces like \ncinder blocks and plywood. Willoughby worked \nwith Hammerpress and its founder, Brady Vest, to \ncreate a library of letterpress imagery derived from \nphotography, drawings, and vintage fonts.\nResults: The whole creative team attended early \ntastings and wine pairings. SPIN! did a soft launch \nwith family and friends for several weeks before \nopening. What started as one concept store in \nKansas City has grown to five in different neigh­\nborhoods. No two environments look the same. In \nevery location there are new elements, such as the \nscrap wood ceilings in SPIN! on Main Street. \nSPIN! has fostered healthier nutrition, community \ninvolvement, regional offerings, flex schedules, and \nservices. SPIN! is planning to expand nationally.\nSPIN! Neapolitan Pizza: Willoughby Design\n297\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: With a fortieth anniversary \nfast approaching in 2011, Starbucks wanted to use \nthe milestone as an opportunity to clarify its future \nvision and refresh its customer experience and \nvisual expression. In early 2010, the Starbucks \nGlobal Creative Studio conducted a comprehen-\nsive brand, marketing, and strategy assessment, \nand began to identify the quintessential elements \nof the brand across touchpoints. Starbucks deter-\nmined through extensive strategic planning that its \nbrand needed the flexibility to explore product \ninnovation, become globally and regionally \nrelevant, and develop an evolved customer experi-\nence. Starbucks decided to free the Siren from the \nlogo and enable customers to make a more per-\nsonal connection with the brand. The internal \ncreative group explored hundreds of graphic alter-\nnatives for the Siren symbol, as well as size and \nrelationship alternatives for use with the Starbucks \n(Coffee) name, before arriving at the simple,  \nclean mark. \nThe Starbucks Global Creative Studio engaged \nLippincott to help refine brand elements, and to \nbring a cross-cultural perspective to building an \nintegrated, multi-platform system. Lippincott’s \nextensive global branding and implementation \nexperience would be valuable during the planning \nphase, and in building consensus within the global \ncorporation.\nCreative solution: Starbucks wanted the visual \nidentity system to say as much about its future as \nit did about its past, building on forty years of trust. \nLippincott examined how the positioning strategy \nwould work across marketing, retail environments \nand packaging, examining the hierarchy of  \nelements from the look and feel to the color,  \ntypography and use of patterns, photography, and \nillustration. Throughout the process, Lippincott \npartnered with the internal creative group to refine \nand define brand elements and character attri-\nbutes, develop implementation guidelines, and \nhelp build consensus among internal stakeholders. \nThe Siren is liberated from her ring and the iden-\ntity is free of words, with a vibrant green \nintroduced to signal the bright future ahead. \nResults: On Tuesday, March 8, 2011, Starbucks \nmarked its fortieth-year celebration. Starbucks \nbegan to roll out the new program to its 16,500 \nstores around the world, starting with the coffee \ncup. Chairman Howard Schultz’s video inspired \ncustomers from around the world to join in conver-\nsation about the Siren. This next evolution of the \nbrand has given Starbucks the freedom and flexi-\nbility to explore innovations and new channels of \ndistribution that will keep the company in step with \ncurrent customers while building strong connec-\ntions with new customers.\nFor forty years the Siren has \nbeen at the center of our \npassion for coffee. And now \nshe’s an icon representing not \nonly our heritage, but also the \nfuture of the Starbucks brand.\nJeffrey Fields\nVice President, Global Creative Studio \nStarbucks\nWe worked closely with the \nStarbucks Global Creative \nStudio to revitalize the brand of \none of the most unique retail \nexperiences in the world.\nConnie Birdsall\nCreative Director\nLippincott\n299\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The business partners \naspired to change the way Americans think about \nsushi, combining age-old Japanese craftsmanship \nwith a whole new dining experience. There are no \nfancy rolls or teriyaki—just unadulterated fresh \nseafood accented with the chef’s signature warm \nrice and homemade ponzu, simply presented. Jerry \nGreenberg and Clement Mok, designer and digital \npioneer, led the branding effort. The brand \npromise, “Surprisingly good food at a fair price \nthat’s quick and easy,” is the centerpiece of the \nnew business that builds on Chef Nozawa’s leg-\nendary status, and two decades of top Zagat \nratings for his restaurant in Studio City. The name \nSUGARFISH is a nod to Nozawa’s reputation for \n“melt in the mouth” sushi. The menu, while always \nchanging to reflect what’s fresh, has been dramati-\ncally simplified. Diners choose from three core \nselections, called Trust Me’s. It’s a prix-fixe menu \nwith tax and gratuities included­—no surprises on \nthe cost.\nCreative solution: Mok collaborated with archi-\ntect Glen Bell and the service staff to design and \nevolve all aspects of guests’ interaction and expe-\nrience, including restaurant interiors, scripts for the \nservers, menu, uniforms, media and promotion pro-\ngrams, signage, and social media initiatives. The \nsparkling, kaleidoscopic big eye tuna brandmark \nMok designed initially was supplemented with a \nsimplified, one-color version for the more modest \napplications, like menus and signage and the take-\nout bento box. When they realized the vibrant, \nbright colors of the original restaurant interiors \ndistracted guests from the food, interior designs \nfor the new locations incorporated more natural \nmaterials in their décor. Since quality and purity of \nthe ingredients are the cornerstones of the brand, \nit was important that marketing and promotion \nefforts reflect that same respect. Food is never \ndiscounted or part of any Groupon-like deals. \nPromotions are personal and the food experience \nshould be shared with friends, as in the free \nbirthday meal email.\nResults: Since opening, SUGARFISH has added \nfour new locations, earning rave reviews and a \nloyal following. Chef Nozawa’s son, Tom, and \nGreenberg are looking to expand the restaurant to \nother cities. The restaurant continues to build on \nNozawa’s mythical status and the uncompromising \nquality of his sushi. The prix-fixe menu and the \nsimplified selection have been a great success \nwith value-conscious, sushi-loving guests. \nLeveraging long-term relationships with the best \nJapanese importers and fish purveyors and elimi-\nnating the middleman to maximize quality and \ncontain costs has made this business model work. \nEach interaction and \ntouchpoint must \ncommunicate the brand \nspirit and serve to \nreinforce the food-centric \nnature of the brand \npromise.\nClement Mok\nHead of Marketing and Brand \nSUGARFISH\n301\n",

Tunerfish was first developed as an app \nthat helps people discover new shows and share \nwhat they are passionate about. Liquid Agency \nwas hired to develop the new company’s brand \nidentity. Liquid’s strategy and creative team from \ntheir offices in San Jose, California, and Santiago, \nChile, met with John McCrea, the founder, and his \nproduct design lead to clarify aspirations, goals, \nand business objectives. As the line between TV \nand the Internet continues to blur, Tunerfish was \nenvisioned as a company at the intersection of the \ntwo. “What should I watch right now?” is a question \nthat could be answered with TV shows, videos, \nand movies. Liquid believed that in order to dra-\nmatically differentiate Tunerfish from its \ncompetition, the design solution needed to be \nunexpected and emotive, with a lot of personality.\nCreative solution: After exploring many varia-\ntions on the idea of a fish, Liquid created a \ncharacter that was quirky, playful, and lovable. Its \nsimple, clean design translates well across digital \nand traditional media. Liquid wanted to infuse the \ncharacter with infinite possibilities. Alfredo \nMuccino, chief creative director at Liquid, posed \nthe question, “What if the character changed into \ndifferent characters depending on the type of \nshow on TV and cinema (drama, comedy, action, \netc.)?” This breakthrough idea worked and the \nmasquerade began: the character holds a martini \nglass for Mad Men, sports fangs for the HBO \nseries True Blood, and wears a hat and cigar to \nsuggest the gangsters in Boardwalk Empire. \nThese icons are also part of the reward eco-\nsystem. The icon does cameo appearances to \nmake people chuckle; inspired by the 007 movies, \none fish introduces himself, “The name is Pond. \nJames Pond.”\nResults: Originally designed for the iPad, Tuner­\nfish is now available on the web and as an app  \nfor Android and iPhone. The company is working \nto bring it to all relevant platforms including  \nIP-­enabled TVs and set-­top boxes. Tunerfish is \nalso working closely with leaders in the most \nforward-­leaning companies in the entertainment \nbusiness, including HBO, Showtime, NBC (for \nDateline and Sunday Night Football) and E! to  \ncreate the best possible social TV experience.  \nThe brand launch attracted a lot of chatter, and \nsubscribers are growing at a handsome pace.\nTunerfish: Liquid Agency\n303\n",

Although \nhalf of the world’s population is female, it has \nnever been politically correct to talk about men-\nstruation, even with one’s family. Historically, the \nmarketing category has been very stagnant and \npredictable. Kimberly-Clark’s market share was \ndeclining, which jumpstarted a process to conduct \nextensive research, identify unmet needs, and find \nopportunities for innovation. The research revealed \nthat the target customers, whether they were \nteenage girls or mature women, were ready for \ntruth and transparency. They wanted to celebrate \ntheir individuality, and they were ready to take a \nsubject that was taboo and bring it out into the \nopen. “We pushed our team to think big and to \nthink differently,” said Jenn Bacon, director, Global \nDesign, Adult & Feminine Care Brands. The cen-\ntral positioning strategy that was developed was \nBreak the Cycle,* which meant that the Kotex \nbrand was ready to help women change the con-\nversation about their periods and vaginal care.\nCreative solution: The Feminine Care cross-\nfunctional teams began to design experiences to \ndrive customer affinity, and to create surprise, \nvariety, and delight on the shelf, on the web, and \nacross social networks, online advertising, and TV. \nBacon’s team envisioned a design strategy that \nwas inspired by cosmetics, beauty and fashion. \nThe brand segment targeted to 14- to 22-year-\nolds was renamed U by Kotex, and the tagline \nbecame  Break the Cycle.* Based on a funda-\nmental belief that good packaging should be \ndisruptive, the new exterior packaging was black, a \nradical leap in the feminine care category. The \nproduct itself, which for almost a century was \nwhite and light blue, is now wrapped in exuberant, \nelectric colors. The look and feel and attitude of \nthe packaging was aligned with the look, feel, and \nvoice of the website, Facebook, and Twitter. \nAcross social networks, the brand is encouraging \ngirls and women to speak out about their bodies \nand health, and to sign a Declaration of Real Talk.\nResults: Pushing the multidisciplinary teams to \nthink differently has had measurable results. The \ncompany that had the foresight to publish the first \nKotex Sanitary ad campaign in 1921 is leading a \ndifferent kind of revolution, bringing innovation to \nthe category, to its brand experience, and to its \ncustomers. The U by Kotex brand has begun to \nhelp women change the conversation about their \nbodies, periods, and vaginal care. As of August \n2012, over four million women have signed up \nonline to help Break the Cycle.*\nwww.ubykotex.com\nU by Kotex: Kimberly-Clark\n305\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The idea for Unstuck \ncame from SYPartners, a transformation company \nthat helps CEOs and their leadership teams  \nduring moments of change. Having worked with \nleaders at companies such as IBM, Starbucks, \nFacebook, and GE, SYPartners wanted to bring  \nits methods to an individual audience. With the \nintroduction of the Apple iPad, the company finally \nfelt it had found the right medium to create a \ntactile, engaging, and (most importantly) human-­\ncentered system that could serve as the first \nUnstuck offering.\nA core team of four people with skills across \nstrategy, product design, project management, and \nproduct development used three key design prin-\nciples to guide the creation of both the brand and \nthe app: It had to be smart but accessible, it had  \nto inspire action, and it had to be empathetic and \naspirational. The team also took inspiration from \ngaming and did extensive research into traditional  \ntherapeutic techniques. Trial and error and user \ntesting helped the team stay on track and in tune \nwith the user base throughout development.\nCreative solution: There are three distinct but \nseamless sections to the app’s flow: figuring out \nhow you’re stuck, learning how to get unstuck,  \nand taking action. Each is infused with candor, wit, \ninformation, and a sense of fun, all of which mask \nthe complex technical underpinnings that make \nthe app effective.\nFrom the user’s perspective, section one consists \nof several multiple-­choice questions asked in an \nengaging, gamelike way. On the back-end, an \nalgorithm based on human behavior patterns dic-\ntates the choices presented to each person, \ndepending on his or her previous answers. \nSimilarly, the prescriptions in section two (how to \nget unstuck) spring from a simple yet encom-\npassing idea that stuck moments result from a gap \nin seeing, believing, thinking, or acting. And in the \nthird section—the tools that help you take action—\nboth the process and the summary screen give \nthe user continual payoff via thought-­provoking \nexercises and presentation. The final takeaway for \nany user: Personalized insight that is actionable in \nreal life.\nResults: Unstuck launched in December 2011, \nand a small team handled everything, from mar-\nketing, public relations, customer service, and \nsocial media to technical bug fixes. The team \ntapped media relationships to get an initial round \nof coverage, listened to what users and reviewers \nwere saying, and spread the word. Unstuck \nreceived coverage from a number of outlets, \nincluding the New Yorker, Oprah.com, TechCrunch, \nLifehacker, and Fast Company. Ultimately, iTunes \nuser reviews determined success, and with a 4.5-­\nstar rating, the download rate continued to grow.\nUnstuck thinking has always gone beyond a single \nproduct. The goal is to broaden and deepen its  \nofferings as well as evolve community interactions. \nUnstuck: SYPartners\n307\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Vueling began as an  \nidea for the first budget airline that would compete \nnationally in Spain and southern Europe from a \nhub in Barcelona. Public opinion of the low-­cost \nairline category was characterized by disappoint-\nment, mistrust, and mixed feelings. Conceived \njointly by founder Carlos Muñoz and Saffron Brand \nConsultants, the challenge was to reinvent the  \ncategory and prove that cheap flights didn’t have \nto mean lower standards of service, comfort, and \nstyle. Saffron began by creating the name. In \nSpain, Spanglish is hip. In Spanish, vuela means  \nto fly, ergo, Vueling. The URL was available—vital \nfor a service that sells mostly online. Saffron pro-\nceeded to design a new experience for customers: \ndirect, simple, unexpected, and down-to-earth with \nlow prices and great service. All brand expressions \nwould embody espíritu Vueling, doing things the \nVueling way. Online transactions would be as  \neasy as one, two, three. New planes, not old, would \nfly from major, not secondary, airports.\nCreative solution: Saffron created the name and \nan entire identity system—not only visual and \nverbal but also behavioral—from nose to tail, from \nstaff-­customer contact to online interface to music \nand menu planning. Straightforward and fast for-\nward, espíritu Vueling inspired all customer \ntouchpoints to feel fresh, cosmopolitan, and cool. \nVoice was first. Saffron engineered a cultural shift \nfrom formal to informal. All brand communications \nspeak informally by using tu, not usted. Airbus \neven had to rewrite the onboard signage for \nVueling’s planes. From the beginning, Saffron and \nVueling management agreed that as a service \nbrand, the people are paramount. The identity \nwork informed the airline’s HR policies, and has \nbeen reinforced subsequently by leading many \nemployee training sessions. After the core brand \nengagement was complete, Saffron continued  \nto keep espíritu Vueling alive through training, and \nworking on their brand committee.\nResults: At launch, Vueling achieved the highest \ncapitalization to date by a new airline in Europe.  \nIt reached its full-­year revenue target of 21 million \neuros within the first six months. In less than a \nyear, Vueling had carried more than 1.2 million \npassengers on twenty-two routes between four-\nteen cities. In 2008, Vueling announced it would \nmerge with Clickair, another low-­cost airline that is \n80 percent owned by flag carrier Iberia. The  \ndecision to name the merged company Vueling \nwas supported by surveys that confirmed the \nsuperior strength of the brand among customers \nand employees. \nVueling was successful \nfrom its start because it \nhad been made by a \ngroup of dreamers,  \nwho dreamed about \nstarting an airline that \npeople in southwest \nEurope needed and \nactually liked.\nFrom day one, the public \nappreciated the full \nexperience of efficiency, \ncare for client, and \nenthusiasm by its staff. \nHard work and learning, \nincluding apologizing  \nto clients for mistakes, \ndid the rest.\nCarlos Muñoz\nFounder\nVueling\n309\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Ann Willoughby had \nalways dreamed of owning a barn that would be a \nplace for innovation and collaboration. Her design \nand brand experience firm in Kansas City, \nMissouri, is thirty-three miles south of her one-\nhundred-­acre working farm, named Bountiful after \nthe 1985 film, A Trip to Bountiful. In 1997, \nWilloughby commissioned a young architect, Dan \nMaginn, who had just founded a new firm, El \nDorado Architects, to design the barn. This would \nbe their first building. The barn was a three-­year \ncollaborative journey between Dan and Ann, a \nliving dialogue about place making, sustainability, \nand design. Siting the structure was challenging; \nits location needed to be close to the old farm-\nhouse, and needed to take advantage of favorable \nbreezes from a nearby wooded ravine. There are \nforests and cropland, a series of tributaries that \nrun into Bee Creek, and red hawks, quail, and wild \nturkeys wander freely.\nCreative solution: Willoughby knew that for the \nbarn to be a place where transformative experi-\nences happened, it must have soaring, light-­filled \nspaces. As an event space, it needed to be flexible \nand accommodate leadership retreats, confer-\nences, and storytelling. The design solution is \nfiercely modern; the one-­of-­a-kind copper barn  \nrespects the land and the farm, and works at a \nvery personal scale. The architects preserved the \nhistory of a Midwestern farm structure, and inte-\ngrated modern amenities like natural glass barn \ndoors that open up to the landscape and a full  \nindustrial kitchen. Fifty-­six percent of the materials \ncame from recycled and reclaimed materials.  \nThe century-­old timber posts and beams were  \nsalvaged from a crumbling barn in Highland, \nMississippi. Ann and Dan selected materials that \nwould age and patinate naturally, such as corru-\ngated copper, reclaimed pine boards, oak flooring, \nand cypress trim. The floors were salvaged from  \na grade school gymnasium.\nResults: In 2004, El Dorado Architects won  \nthe AIA Award of Excellence for the Willoughby \nDesign Barn in the Central States Region. The  \njury was impressed with the barn’s simplicity, utility, \nand elegance, and the thoughtful use of materials. \nOver the last decade, business leaders, designers, \nentrepreneurs, scientists, and leadership and \nbranding teams have come to the barn to reflect \nand revitalize their vision for the future. The barn \nhas been a venue for Willoughby clients, inno­\nvation conferences, and most recently a brand \nboot camp for twenty-six entrepreneurial founders  \nfrom Kauffman Labs.\nWilloughby Design Barn: ElDorado Architects\n311\n",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The National Center  \nfor Family Literacy (NCFL) wanted a new way to \nengage families and educators in learning that \nwould broaden their reach. The NCFL retained \nBrains on Fire to reimagine what could be a game-­\nchanger in literacy improvement efforts. Brains  \non Fire embarked on a nationwide insight tour to \ntalk with single, working-­class, and immigrant par-\nents about how they engage in learning with their \nchildren. From the heartland of Ohio to New York \nand Los Angeles, they found that parents and \nedu­cators were not seeking resources on how to \ninstruct their children. Instead, they needed a free \nand easy way to inspire them. Rather than building \na website strictly about how to encourage literacy, \nBrains on Fire and NCFL envisioned a place and \nan experience that nurtured the sense of wonder \ninside everyone. Reframing the conversation \naround literacy could begin with a simple idea—\nstart with curiosity and learning, and literacy will \nfollow; start with questions, not answers.\nCreative solution: The name, Wonderopolis,  \nwas created by Brains on Fire to convey a magical \nplace where wonder and learning are nurtured \nthrough the power of discovery, creativity, and \nimagination. Wonderopolis.org is an online \nresource that provides fresh and relevant content \nthat engages families and educators, and works \nwithin the reality of modern family life. Every day, \nkids are offered a new Wonder of the Day,  \ninspired by the kinds of things that kids naturally \nwonder about, from “Why are flamingos pink?” \n(Wonder #1) to “How hot is the sun?” (Wonder \n#332). Bite-­sized pieces of information along  \nwith pictures and video are ideal for busy families. \nWonderopolis.org was launched in October  \n2010 to ignite a conversation by engaging users in \na two-­way dialogue online, on Facebook and \nTwitter. Building on these core ideas, a pilot pro-\ngram called Camp What-­a-­Wonder was developed  \nto specifically address the goal of engaging  \nkids and families in daily learning during the \nsummer months.\nResults: In its first month, Wonderopolis attracted \nover 18,500 visitors, and the number of monthly \nunique visitors grew by 670 percent in the first \neight months. There was a limited budget for mar-\nketing and PR, and growth was fueled mostly by \npeople sharing Wonderopolis organically on \nTwitter and Facebook. Wonderopolis has enjoyed \nunsolicited reviews in more than one hundred \nonline publications and blogs. Time magazine \nnamed Wonderopolis one of 2011’s “50  \nBest Websites.” EducationWorld.com gave \nWonderopolis five stars for its high-­quality infor-\nmation and ability to bring fun into the classroom.\nOur Wonders of the Day \nwill help you find learning \nmoments in everyday life, \nones that fit in with a \nstolen moment between \nbreakfast and the bus, or \nwithin school curriculum \nand education programs.\nWonderopolis.org\nWonderopolis: Brains on Fire\n313\n",

A \nbrand consultant and coach, she describes \nher work as strategic imagination. Her passion \nis brand identity: how organizations express \nwho they are and what they stand for. Over her \ncareer, she has worked with large enterprises, \nentrepreneurial ventures, and nonprofits. Her \nmantra is, “Who are you? Who needs to know? \nWhy should they care? How will they find out?” \nHer one-day Speed of Light workshops review \nthe branding tools and fundamentals, five-\nphase process, and best practices featured in \nDesigning Brand Identity. Whether meeting with \nthe leadership team, the board of directors, \nor the design team, she brings high energy, \nempathy, and insights to her simple and \nactionable solutions and strategies.\nIn Wheeler’s intensive Inside/Outside brand \nlabs, she works with multidisciplinary teams to \nsolve complex branding problems. She engages \norganizations in a rigorous and collaborative \nprocess to achieve remarkable results, build \ntrust, and transcend silos. She inspires branding \nteams to seize every opportunity to design \ncompelling customer experiences, touchpoint  \nby touchpoint. \nIn addition to authoring four editions of \nDesigning Brand Identity, Wheeler collaborated \nwith information designer Joel Katz on Brand \nAtlas: Branding Intelligence Made Visible (Wiley), \na radical reinvention of a business book that \nuses provocative diagrams and minimal text to \ncommunicate about marketplace dynamics and \nbrand fundamentals.\nWhen not on the road, Wheeler works in her \nbrand laboratory in Philadelphia, or in Keene \nValley, an Adirondack hamlet. She and her \nphotographer husband, Ed, love to hike, make \nart, and laugh a lot. They have been married \nsince 1977, and have two daughters and  \ntwo grandsons.\nFor consulting engagments  \nand speaking inquiries: \nalina@alinawheeler.com\nFor comments or inquiries about \nDesigning Brand Identity:  \nauthor@alinawheeler.com\n@alinawheeler\n",

Design is an ever-evolving profession. If you’re like me, \none of your goals as a graphic designer is to always improve \nyour skills so that you can attract the clients you want. So it’s \nvital that you keep learning and growing.\nThis book is about sharing with you everything that I know \nabout creating brand identities so that you can stay motivated \nand inspired, and make smart and well-informed decisions when \nprocuring and working with your clients.\nBut who am I, and what reason do you have for heeding\nmy advice?\nWell, for a number of years I’ve been sharing design projects on \nmy blogs at davidairey.com and logodesignlove.com. In these \nblogs, I walk my readers through the individual stages of my \nidentity design projects. I talk about how I sealed the deal with \na client. I examine the details of a design brief. And I describe \nhow a client might sign off on polished artwork.\nMy websites currently generate 1 million monthly page views \nand have a combined subscriber count of more than 30,000 \nreaders.

They say that my features are helpful, \ninspiring, and very much appreciated (and I didn’t pay them\nfor their comments, I promise!). \nIf you search through the portfolios of the most successful \ndesign agencies and studios, you’ll ﬁ nd plenty of examples of \nﬁ nal design work. Some portfolios might even show one or two \nalternative concepts. For the most part, however, we can ﬁ nd \nvery little of what actually happens between designers and their \nclients: the questions they ask to get projects started on the \nright foot, how they generate ideas after creating and studying \nthe design brief, and how they present their designs to win their \nclient’s approval. Such details are like gold dust to a designer.\nAnd so, the idea for this book was born.\nNever before have I gone into so much detail about my design \nprocess, and never before have I studied the intricacies in such \ndepth. In the process, I’ve brought many talented designers and \ndesign studios on board who very graciously have shared their \nown thoughts, processes, and advice.\nWhen you ﬁ nish reading this book, you hopefully will be \nwell-prepared to go out and win your own clients and create \nyour own iconic brand identities.

How many logos can \nyou see?\nReuters magazine proclaimed in 1997 that “In the last 30 years, \nmankind has produced more information than in the previous \n5,000.”2 Because humanity is now producing such a vast \namount of information, we’re seeing logos that are increasingly \nsimilar to one another. This poses a problem for companies that \nare trying to differentiate themselves visually, but it also creates \nan opportunity for designers who are skilled enough to create \niconic designs that stand above the crowd.\nTake, for instance, 300million, \none of the United Kingdom’s top \ncreative agencies, which spent \ntwo weeks creating and crafting \nthis logo, making excellent use \nof negative space to show a \nspoon inside a pen nib.\n“What you take away is just as important as what you keep,” \nsaid Katie Morgan, senior designer at 300million.\nSeeing just one great design like this is a testament to the work \nof creative agencies like 300million, as well as ideal inspiration \nfor designers everywhere who continually strive to create \nbrilliant designs. Let’s take a look at a few more in Chapter 2.\n2 \n“Information Overload Causes Stress.” Reuters magazine, March/April 1997.

Because people often choose \nproducts based on their perceived value rather than their\nactual value. \nThink about the celebrity who drives an Aston Martin instead \nof, say, a Skoda, which is continually ranked “car of the year” in \nmany European countries and delivers much better mileage at a \nsigniﬁ cantly cheaper price. Sure, Skoda is the logical choice, but \nit’s Aston Martin’s identity, which conjures images of luxury and \nstatus, that usually clinches the sale. Then there’s Lexus versus \nScion.

The exhibition is the largest property \nevent in the United Kingdom for people who are interested in \nbuying homes in France. Executives at French Property News, \nthe U.K.-based French-property publication that organizes the \nevent, felt that the original logo was no longer appropriate.\nIt was more reminiscent of a French bistro than a major \nexhibition event. The angle of the brushstrokes was a distortion \nof the French tricolor. And the type felt somewhat frivolous.\nEnglish-based designer Roy Smith was given the task of \nredesigning the logo. \n“I explored various directions in the form of thumbnail \nsketches—a vital part of the conceptualization process.\nThe French ﬂ ag, rooftops, and louvred shutters—very much\na French icon,” said Smith.\n",

They \neither represent a newly established company in need of a \nnew identity, or an already established company that desires a \nredesigned or reﬁ ned brand identity.\nIf your project falls into the ﬁ rst category—designing from \nscratch—the process is much simpler, since there’s no brand \nequity for the designer and client to consider. But if you’ve been \nasked to do a redesign, the stakes are much higher, for both \nyou and your client. Think about it. Which scenario is potentially \nmore damaging: Nike ditching its internationally recognized \n“swoosh” logo in favor of, say, the outline of a shoe, or a new \nbusiness named “Pete’s” comissioning a visual identity to help \nsell its custom t-shirts? Because of Nike’s stature, stock, and \nvisibility in the marketplace, the potential for damage to the \ncompany’s identity is much greater. \nThat said, a redesign project tends to be much more lucrative \nfor the designer than creating a design from scratch. Because \nestablished companies need to be protective of the equity \nthey have already built around their identity, a lengthier, more \nstringent design process is required. Every decision requires \nmore thought, and more discussion.\n",

Or maybe your client is an \narchitectural studio, with the committee comprising the \npartners in the ﬁ rm.

In these cases, empathy is\na powerful marketing tool. \nBy placing yourself in your contact’s shoes, you will likely see \nthat presenting the design ideas to the committee as a whole \nis at the top of her priority list, too, and that any help you can \noffer will be greatly appreciated.\nI was tasked in 2006 with creating a logo and stationery \npackage for a company in Scotland called Davidson Locksmith. \nFrom the start of the project until it was time to present my \nideas, I dealt with Paul Davidson, the company owner’s son.\n",

You need to remove anything that can \nhinder the process at this very delicate stage.\nBut sometimes this is easier said than done.

It’s as simple and as \nhard as that.”\nBut don’t overwork yourself\nDo you know the famous line from Stephen King’s The Shining? \n“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” Just like in the \nmovie, starving yourself of everything but work will only lead\nto unhappiness. \nUsing timelines and schedules allows you to more precisely \nfactor how long speciﬁ c tasks will take, and helps ensure you’re \nnot under any undue pressure when it comes to delivering to \nthe client. Of course, the design process usually takes longer \nthan most people think, and a certain level of overwork comes \nwith the territory.\n",

They usually don’t know the time it takes to \n \ncomplete design work, so in their minds they believe it can \n \nbe done on the cheap.\nA. I’m reluctant to work with friends or family because there’s \n \nalways a danger that exchanging money between people \n \nclose to you can ruin your relationship.\n \nBut, of course, it can also be difﬁ cult to say, “No.”\n",

People want\nreal guidance, real stories from the trenches, and real\ntakeaways. People have ideas—whether it’s a brilliant\nnew tech product, a powerful documentary, or a\ngorgeous piece of design—and they want to know\nhow to capture the attention of the crowd and\nconvince complete strangers to fund their dreams.\nI’ve raised over $20 million (and counting) for\nclients’ crowdfunding campaigns around the world,\nand I have a lot to share. My clients pay me a\nconsiderable amount of money for my guidance and\nexpertise, but I’m giving away all my best advice in\nthese pages. Why? Well, crowdfunding has given me\na lot—my career, my company, my sense of purpose,\nand the amazing experience of an entire community\ngetting behind what you’re doing. I love the\negalitarianism of crowdfunding—I love that it’s\navailable to all, and not just the privileged few. I want\nto give back to the crowdfunding community that has\ngiven me so much. That’s why I’m here. So hi!\n",

Let’s get started.\nSince I first started managing crowdfunding\ncampaigns as a freelancer in 2012, and after launching\nmy company, Vann Alexandra, in 2014, I’ve worked on\nan incredible range of projects. I spent my early days\nfunding documentaries, and now I’ve grown a\nbusiness that runs major campaigns of all kinds\naround the world.\nSo here’s how it works: Clients come to us with an\nidea, and we build and manage the entire\ncrowdfunding campaign for them from beginning to\nend—from copywriting, pitching press, developing an\ninfluencer strategy, and managing the video\nproduction to donor engagement, design strategy,\nmessaging, email marketing, and all the day-to-day\ncommunication and handling of ongoing details. Some\nof my projects involve big names—Dr. Maya Angelou,\nTLC, Neil Young, Joan Didion—while many others\ncome from everyday people with great ideas. One of\nmy recent campaigns was to reissue an out-of-print\nNASA Graphics Standards Manual by two\ntwentysomething graphic designers. It raised just shy\nof $1 million.\nI’m here to tell you with complete confidence that\nthere are thousands of people out there who are\neager to put money toward projects they believe in.

The harsh reality is that\nthe majority of crowdfunding campaigns fail. Just look\nat one of the most successful rewards-based\ncrowdfunding platforms in the world, Kickstarter. As I\nwrite this, there are more than 4,000 live campaigns;\nstatistically less than 40 percent of them are likely to\nmeet their goals. And recent research reveals that\nthose success rates will continue to decline as the\nmarket grows. Plus, failing on Kickstarter means\nfailing hard—if you fall short of your goal by the\ndeadline, you won’t see any of the money you’ve\nraised, and you might actually tarnish your shiny idea.\nLaunching a crowdfunding campaign is very public. If\nit fails, your backers might be gun-shy about giving\nyou another chance.\nThe truth is, if you want to fund your idea, you’ll\nneed to be prepared to invest blood, sweat, tears,\nhundreds of hours, and a ton of strategizing to ensure\nyour campaign succeeds.\nThe good news is this: if I can be successful at\ncrowdfunding, so can you. These days, I’m known as\nThe Crowdsourceress because of my extremely high\nsuccess rate—I have some of the most successful\n(and some of the most famous) campaigns under my\nbelt. But back when I first started, I was pretty much\nclueless. The first time someone asked me to help\nwith a project, I had to Google “Kickstarter” to find\n",

    "chunk_full": "A LITTLE BACKSTORY\nCrowdfunding brings out the entrepreneurial spirit in\npeople. I think that entrepreneurship is something\nthat’s partly innate but can also definitely be\ncultivated, whether it’s the influence of our parents\nwhen we’re young, or from random people and events\nthat come into our lives along the way. In my case, it\nwas a little bit of each.\nI grew up in Miami in the ’80s and ’90s. My dad\nowned a company that created anti–money laundering\nsoftware for banks and financial institutions, and my\nmom owned a company that did marketing for radio\nand television stations. I remember going to my\nmom’s office almost every day after school with my\nolder brother and doing my homework in the\nconference room, surrounded by ringing phones,\nmeetings in progress, and the controlled chaos of\npeople working hard toward production deadlines.\nLooking back, I know I absorbed some of my parents’\nentrepreneurial drive. It’s worth noting that I am\nextremely lucky to have had the opportunity to learn\nfrom my parents. Not everyone gets that chance.\nUltimately, what I really learned from my parents was\nthe value of hard work. When my parents met, they\nhad nothing; they built their companies from scratch.\nA big part of running a successful business is the\nhead-down work involved—also a critical component\nof a successful crowdfunding campaign.\n",

I\nknew I liked writing, so I gravitated toward Spanish\nliterature and philosophy classes where I was able to\nspend a lot of time discussing and reading books,\nanalyzing theories and literature, and having long\nconversations with my philosophy thesis professor. If\nyou want to know how confused I was at this point in\nmy life, you only have to look at the title of my honors\nthesis: “Existentialism in Contemporary Drug\nCinema.”\nMy inclination toward writing seemed to point\nnaturally in the direction of journalism, and when I\ngraduated, I got a paid internship at New York\nmagazine and then went on to my first freelance\nposition as a fact checker for WSJ magazine. But even\nwith my new role, I was still lost. While I loved the\npeople I worked with and the magazine, I realized I\ndidn’t want to work in journalism.\nBy now, my philosophy thesis professor had moved\nto New York for another job, so I would take him for\ndrinks to get insight on what to do next. I also started\nto meet with colleagues I admired to ask their advice.\n(I urge you to find people you can talk to as you are\nsearching for what you want to do.)

By\nthe last day of the 30-day campaign, we had\nsurpassed our $50,000 goal by more than 60 percent,\nultimately raising over $80,000.\nI don’t remember sleeping much those 30 days, but\nI do remember watching the computer screen as\npledges came in, from kind friends and family\nmembers, and from strangers who felt that this\nproject was worth supporting.

    "chunk_full": "CROWDFUNDING 101\nFirst things first: in rewards-based crowdfunding,\nproject creators raise money for projects through\nonline pledges from backers, and in return, backers\nget a reward. For example, in the film category, a\nreward might be a copy of the film, a poster, dinner\nwith the director, or a name in the credits. What’s\nreally fascinating about rewards-based crowdfunding\nis that backers are essentially donating to a project,\nnot investing in it. In the case of many crowdfunding\ncampaigns—like the ones that raise money for film\nediting—backers are pledging to help make your\nproject happen, not necessarily to place an order on a\nproduct.\nTwo widely used rewards-based crowdfunding\nplatforms are Kickstarter and Indiegogo, where\ncreators set a monetary goal to reach within a limited\nperiod of time (for example, 30, 45, or 60 days). A\ncritical difference between Kickstarter and Indiegogo\nis that funding on Kickstarter is always all-or-nothing. If\na creator raises only $49,000 toward a $50,000 goal\non Kickstarter, they get nothing. On the other hand, on\nIndiegogo, creators can run a campaign with an all-or-\nnothing “fixed” model or with flexible funding.\nFlexible funding means creators keep the money they\nraise, even if they don’t hit their target.\n",

Kickstarter,\nfor instance, calls people who launch campaigns\n“creators,” while Indiegogo calls them\n“campaign owners.”\nPeople who put money toward a project?\nThey’re “backers” on Kickstarter and\n“contributors” on Indiegogo, and in exchange for\ngiving money to a campaign, you get a “reward”\non Kickstarter and a “perk” on Indiegogo.\nBoth platforms have been great to work with,\nbut since most of the campaigns I’ve run have\nbeen on Kickstarter, I tend to use Kickstarter\nterms. But don’t get hung up on language! Each\npair of terms basically means the same thing.\nWhen clients come to me asking which platform to\nuse, I tell them it’s really up to them to determine\nwhich one they are most comfortable with. Both\nplatforms can lead you to success, but if you’re\ndeciding between Indiegogo and Kickstarter, and you\nknow you need the flexible funding option, Indiegogo\nis your only option. In my experience, though, most of\nthe campaigns I run actually can’t consider the flexible\nmodel. They know the amount of funding they need\n",

WFMU’s\nprogramming includes every kind of music you might\nimagine, from what WFMU calls “flat-out\nuncategorizable strangeness” to rock and roll, jazz,\nelectronica, hip-hop, punk rock, cooking instructions,\nfound sound, and much, much more.\nThe more I learned about WFMU, the more I fell in\nlove with its persistent independence and anti-\nestablishment ethos. It turns out I wasn’t the only\none. Over the years, WFMU had built up a strong cult\nfollowing. “Hands down WFMU is the greatest radio\nstation on the planet,” filmmaker Jim Jarmusch has\nsaid. The Village Voice called it “the crown jewel of\nNew York independent radio.” Still, part of the story\nTim wanted to tell through the documentary was how,\nyear after year, WFMU struggles financially,\nperpetually on the brink of shutting down.\nTim started shooting the documentary in 2009, at\nthe height of the Great Recession.

For most campaigns, pledges will\ncome in strongly at the beginning and end, but they\nwill be weaker in the middle (read more about this in\nchapter 6).\nTim and I kept plugging away, staying active on\nsocial media and pitching new press outlets. As the\ncampaign progressed, Tim also released updates to\nbackers through Kickstarter. Instead of writing generic\nmessages, like “We’re doing great! Keep spreading\nthe word!” Tim shared new, fun, useful content, like\nvideos where he’d update backers about rewards and\npress coverage, and exclusive videos from the WFMU\narchives. This became another strategy I’ve since\ntaken to other campaigns: planning interesting content\nto share with backers throughout the campaign is\nreally valuable. It’s how you show your sincere\nappreciation, form a community (that’s what\ncrowdfunding is all about), and keep people interested\nin the campaign. Releasing new rewards during the\ncampaign is also a great way to generate new interest\nand attention.\n",

Without the WFMU listeners, I\ndon’t know if we could have made it to the finish line.\nThe number one thing I learned in my first\ncrowdfunding campaign is the power of the fan base\n—the built-in audience.\nA built-in audience is the most motivated,\nenthusiastic segment of your “crowd.” They are the\npeople who make your project a success.

They make stunning\ndocumentaries and films for leading arts organizations\nsuch as the Peabody Award–winning Art21 and other\nbig corporations like Sprint and Pepsi. I got to\nexperience their talent for myself when we hired them\nto create the Kickstarter video for the Joan Didion\ndocumentary campaign. Since then, I’ve partnered\nwith them on some hugely successful crowdfunding\nprojects, and I am always blown away and inspired by\ntheir work. So I asked them for their thoughts on\nmaking a successful crowdfunding video.\nFirst, we talked about some of the challenges. You\ncan probably guess one of the hardest things about\nmaking a crowdfunding video: fitting it all in! You have\nto take something that’s complex and has a lot of\nparts and boil it down to a video that’s short, powerful,\nand has a strong message. (That’s why it’s so\nimportant to write out a script and get feedback on it.)\nRAVA also pointed out that while the call-to-action\nof the campaign is to get pledges, that shouldn’t be\nthe focus of the film. Instead, strive to make the story\nitself as strong as possible because that’s what will\nmake viewers want to pledge—not asking them to.\n",

The\nvideo introduces you and your campaign to a new\naudience. It’s a lot different from traditional\nadvertising, where you’re usually talking to a seasoned\naudience. (Think about how many times you’ve seen a\nCoke ad, for example.) With crowdfunding, you’re\ntypically initiating a new relationship with a new\naudience. “That’s why you have to think so much\nabout how you’re building an identity,” RAVA says.\n“You’re not just making a video, you’re creating a\nbrand image around the project. The video, and the\nwhole campaign, is an exercise in branding.” (We will\ngo deeper into this in chapter 4.)\nThis might seem obvious, but RAVA says to avoid\nclosely mimicking other campaigns. “Sometimes\npeople think there’s a magic formula and if you\nreplicate the same video or the same idea that worked\nfor another campaign, then you also will succeed,”\nRAVA points out. But every company or project has to\nfind its own language and messaging.\nWhen it comes to actually making the video, RAVA\ntoo suggests trying to achieve as much production\nquality as possible. If you have a limited budget, a DIY\nvideo is an option, but not everyone can pull it off. Try\nto find people in your network who have professional\nexperience in video production, and focus on quality\n",

Digital rewards are generally\neasier to produce and cost nothing to ship. What we\ntend to suggest for digital rewards is to email\neveryone who backed a digital reward after the\ncampaign with a link so they can download the\nreward.\nThat’s the approach we took with a few rewards for\nthe Joan Didion campaign. One reward, for instance,\nwas a set of weekly columns that Didion and her\nhusband, John, wrote for the Saturday Evening Post.\nWe offered a special collection as a PDF, and after the\ncampaign, we sent it to backers via Dropbox.\n",

Because remember that you are building\nyour brand, and you want to maintain a great\nrelationship with supporters.\nWhen Hamish and I ran a successful Kickstarter\ncampaign to fund a poster of all 469 NYC subway\nstops, some posters were damaged during the\nshipping process, and a handful of backers didn’t like\nthem. When backers let us know, we quickly shipped\nout new posters or refunded them. It was money lost\non our end, but we wanted to show good customer\nservice and avoid negative feedback. Plus, this is one\nreason why all campaign budgets should include a\nbuffer—things go wrong, and you’ll need that money\nto fix them.\nSince I’ve made these mistakes and learned these\nlessons, I hope you won’t have to. Nonetheless, in\ncrowdfunding—just like anything else—there are\nbound to be bumps in the road. My best advice is to\ninvest time up front researching and preparing, then\nkeep a positive attitude for the ride! There are\nsolutions for almost everything.\n",

The\nconcept is simple: successful campaigns are the result\nof having a crowd that will fund you. Your friends and\nfamily are, in most cases, not a big enough crowd. To\naccess a bigger crowd, you have to get more eyes on\nyour project, and reaching people through press\ncoverage and social media are two fundamental and\nhighly effective ways of doing that. Plus, this part of\ncrowdfunding can be incredibly fun. It’s a chance to be\ncreative, think outside the box, expand your network,\nand build your community.\n",

Social media,\nin all its forms, for all its flaws and powers, is a tool for\nforming community. That’s what makes it so\nimportant to the success of your campaign.\nRegardless of how the technical structures and\ncomponents of social media change over time, the\nfoundation of effective communication online won’t.\nIn all of our social media strategies, we strive to\ncommunicate in ways that are relevant, clear and\nconcise, engaging and actionable, and visual and\ninteresting.\nFor most projects, before a campaign launches, we\ndevelop a social media campaign by finding and\npartnering with influencers on Facebook, Twitter,\nand/or other platforms relevant to our campaign and\naudience. We also create a plan of who will share\ncontent (us, the client, influencers), when it will be\nposted (how often and at what time of day), and what\nwill be shared (we write sample posts, talk about\nhashtags and formatting, etc.). We also share other\ntips—for example, if you haven’t posted in awhile, up\nthe frequency of your posts to repopulate the page\nbefore getting into a regular posting groove.\n",

People on your mailing list have already\nactively engaged with you in some way (by signing up\nto receive your emails), so they’re likely to be some of\nyour best supporters (including interested subscribers,\nfriends, family, colleagues, and more).\nGenerally, a client will send us their mailing list\nbefore a campaign so we can plan to reach out to their\nnetwork in the weeks leading up to launch. Once we\nreceive it (usually in a CSV file), we upload it to an\nemail marketing tool like MailChimp.\nTypically, about four weeks before launch, we send\na teaser email that hints at the upcoming campaign\nwithout giving away any important details, to build\nanticipation. Then, about two weeks out, we\nannounce the campaign with a short message and\nstrong image. We might announce a social media\ncontest or giveaway campaign at this time as well to\nget the ball rolling.\nOne week before launch (or less), we share even\nmore details about the campaign and let our networks\nknow that we will need their help with spreading the\nword (and pledging!) on Launch Day. We tell our list\nthat they will be the first to know about the campaign,\nand usually mention that there will be an early-bird,\ndiscounted, limited edition reward that they can jump\non (this helps!).\n",

If you\ncan tap into that, you can harness a real\npower—and get people to share your video.\nYou don’t need celebrity or fame for this.\nYou just need to know your story and your\naudience, and to draw an emotional\nconnection between them. With Joan\nDidion, we underscored themes of\nAmerican culture, family, the fragility of life,\ngrief, and memory. There was the\nemotionality from Didion’s story, but beyond\nthat, there was a sense of emotion from the\ndirector Griffin in his storytelling.\n",

In other\nwords, how could we leverage our access to her to\noffer something unique? An autographed book was\nobvious. What was something outside the box? After\na lot of researching and reading, my head of projects\nat the time proposed a book of Joan Didion’s favorite\nrecipes—she had been well known for the dinner\nparties she and her husband hosted in California in the\n’70s. Annabelle found her handwritten personal\nrecipes, and we scanned them. Hamish was brought\non to design the digital reward assets, and he put the\nrecipes together in a cohesive, beautifully designed\nPDF. Backers were thrilled to get their hands on\nsomething so personal to Didion, and it became one\nof the biggest hits among our rewards.\nWe applied a similar approach to compile a list of\nother personal rewards: a handwritten list of Joan\nDidion’s twelve most important books to read before\nyou die; a collection of Saturday Evening Post columns\nthat she and her husband, John, had written; a\nchronicle of Joan Didion’s life and work compiled via\noral history by Annabelle; the opportunity to send a\nletter to Didion that would be read to her; and a big\none: a pair of Joan Didion’s iconic sunglasses, donated\nby the writer herself.\nWe also included some typical rewards, like digital\naccess to the film upon release.

The\naesthetic was also intentional: before sharing\nanything, we created a style guide where we laid out\nexactly the kinds of photos and quotes we wanted to\nshare.

Later, in a New\nYork Times profile titled “Fashion’s Gaze Turned to\nJoan Didion in 2015,” Matthew Schneier wrote about\nDidion’s prevalence following the Kickstarter.\nGoing into a campaign, there’s never a way to know\nexactly how it will pan out. The best you can do is\nresearch, prepare, and prepare some more. No one on\nour team could have predicted what happened with\nthe Didion Doc. Griffin later told Variety.com: “We\nwere flabbergasted by the love and dollars and cents\nthat came flooding in from all over the world. It was\nalmost as if people wanted to thank Joan for\neverything she’s written. These are passionate fans\nwho couldn’t wait for this to happen.”\nPassionate fans indeed.

But more and\nmore, my clients and I are looking at a bigger picture.\nA crowdfunding campaign is just a moment (a big\nmoment) in the much longer life of a brand, business,\nor idea. Increasingly, my work also focuses on what\ncomes next: the aftermath of a crowdfunding\ncampaign.\nWe’ve covered a lot about preparing for rewards\nfulfillment, figuring out the logistics, thanking backers\nand journalists, and, of course, doing the work you\nraised the money to do.

I have talked about how the flow of\nfunding for most crowdfunding campaigns tends to\nfollow an inverse bell curve, where most funds come\nin at the very beginning and very end of a campaign,\nwhen there’s the most energy, momentum, and\nurgency. The uptick in funding as a campaign nears its\nend date is amazing—it can mean you get the final\npush to meet your funding goal just in the nick of\ntime, or, even if you already met your goal, the extra\ncash can go to anything from product enhancements\nto speeding up the editing for your film, to pushing up\nthe delivery date of your rewards, to plenty of other\nbenefits for both you and your backers.\nBut, at some point, the campaign does finish. When\ntime’s up, that’s it. No more pledges can come\nthrough. This can feel like a loss to creators, who\nmight still be seeing a ton of traffic on the campaign\npage at the end. Sometimes, emails come in saying\nthings like “I missed your campaign! How can I get\nthis?” Many creators wonder how they can capitalize\non an interested audience once time’s up.

As if you don’t have enough stuff to do during\nthe campaign, it’s ideal to have a website with an\nonline store ready right when the campaign is over, so\nvisitors have a place to go to if they missed the\ncampaign. Still, be mindful of what you promised your\ncrowdfunding backers.

Even as I launched my second\nand third campaigns, I still felt like I was running\naround in the dark, trying to cling to strategies that\nworked and throwing out ones that didn’t.\nLess than two years after I helped raise $80,000 for\nSex and Broadcasting, I helped smash an $800,000\ngoal within 24 hours for Neil Young’s PonoPlayer\ncampaign. It was clear that this wasn’t just my\npersonal experience; crowdfunding was a fast-moving\nfinancial movement. As I write this in 2016, more than\n$1 billion has been raised on Indiegogo, and about\n$2.8 billion has been pledged to Kickstarter projects.\nThe growth across the crowdfunding space is almost\nunbelievable.\nI spoke with Evan Cohen, the former senior director\nof design, technology, and hardware at Indiegogo,\nabout how crowdfunding has changed since its\ninception. Evan explained how he thinks about the\nevolution of crowdfunding in two stages: In the early\nera of crowdfunding, between 2008 and 2013, most\ncampaigns were run by one person or a small team\nthat needed to raise money to take a project from\npoint A to point B; they needed a little money to keep\nsomething going—to finish editing a film, for example.\n“But around late 2012 and early 2013,” Evan said,\n",

But\nthose aren’t the only campaigns out there.\nCrowdfunding remains a democratic and inclusive\nspace, which is what I love about it.\nThere are now plenty of industry-specific platforms\nwhere creators can take advantage of crowdfunding in\na community and environment that meets their needs\n(sites dedicated to crowdfunding for music or for\ngames, for example). “We’re seeing the crowdfunding\necosystem evolve and stratify—different platforms\nprovide different things,” Justin Kazmark, VP of\ncommunications at Kickstarter told me. “Kickstarter is\n",

When you’re making any kind of\ntransaction—even if it’s a small amount of money or\nbetween friends—you need a contract, and to have a\nstrong contract, you need a lawyer. Lawyers are\nnotoriously expensive. But I got connected with a law\nfirm that helps startups, and I asked them to help me\nbuild contracts that I could customize in the future:\none for team members and one for clients. My lawyer\nalso advised me that if I could continue to own 100\npercent of my company, I should. If you have enough\nmoney to run your business, he advised, don’t give up\nequity. It was great advice that I still follow today.\nMaintaining ownership of my company is one of the\nthings I’m most proud of. As hard as it is, I absolutely\nlove the freedom of being able to make decisions\nindependently and do my own thing. (A note: This\nworked great for my business, which is services\nfocused, but that wouldn’t be the case for everyone.\nSome startups require a ton of capital to get started. If\nthat’s your situation, look for a lawyer who works with\nstartups that need capital.)\nEarlier on, we also got support from a publicist who\nhelped lock in press and spread the word about the\nwork we were doing. I think it’s great to bring on this\nkind of support when you launch—whether it’s a\npublicist or digital marketer—in order to get traction in\n",

In my case, I’ve\nbeen really fortunate to be able to lean on my parents\nfor guidance, especially in the beginning. My mom and\ndad, both seasoned entrepreneurs, were a phone call\naway whenever I felt like I was in over my head\n(which was often). They were the ones who said,\n“Never turn down new business. You can always find\nhelp,” and countless other words of wisdom. Their\nunconditional support has been beyond valuable to\nme.\nIf, like me, you don’t have an MBA or any prior\nbusiness experience, then either seeking out mentors\nor reading up is a must. Educate yourself. Don’t be\nafraid to ask questions—if you’re too worried about\nappearing inexperienced, you could miss out on vital\ninformation. Recently, after turning to my parents and\ntrusted friends, I decided to get actual advisors—\npeople in the field that I could talk to about my\nbusiness model, clients, pricing, projects, and many\nother things. It really helps to have an outside opinion\ncoming from those who are wiser than you in your\nindustry.

Thank you,\nEmma, for thinking I was worthy and for your help\nalong the way.\nI had no idea how to write a book proposal, so\nthrough Emma I was introduced to the lovely and\namazing Eve Claxton who brought along the equally\nlovely and amazing Kelly Shetron to help me craft my\nwords into a substantial 55-page document (beautifully\ndesigned by Hamish). It was then that I had the\nprivilege of being chosen by the great Colleen Lawrie\nas one of her writers at PublicAffairs.\nThen I needed to write the book. I couldn’t have\ndone that without so many people. It’s to all of you\nthat I share my deepest thanks.\nTo Kelly, for extensive and exceptional support in\nhelping me write this book. The interviews, the\ndeadlines, the attention to detail, the kindness, and\nthe patience. You are a gem, Kelly. This book wouldn’t\nexist without you.\nTo Eve, for helping me create a proposal that\nshined. For being there from the beginning to the end,\n",
