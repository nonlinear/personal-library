This is the \ncase, for example, for decisions made by health profession-\nals, by judges or by bankers. This need is acknowledged, to \nsome extent, by the GDPR, which states that a person who is \n“subject to a decision based solely on automated processing” \nhas “the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the \ncontroller, to express his or her point of view and to contest \nthe decision” (Article 22(3)). However, there can be many \nbarriers preventing this right from being exercised, the first \none being the practical difficulty to understand the grounds \nfor a decision based on the results of an ADS. To ensure \nthat this right can be effective, we argue that contestability \nshould be supported by appropriate tools. As stated by Mul-\nligan et al., “contestability can support critical, generative, \nand responsible engagement between users and algorithms, \nusers and system designers, and ideally between users and \nthose subject to decisions (when they are not the users), as \nwell as the public” [29]. Indeed, providing ways to contest a \ndecision can be beneficial in many respects:\n–\t It makes the ADS more effective because it enhances the \nability of the human decision maker to detect inappropri-\nate results (suggestions of wrong decisions).\n–\t It makes the ADS more accountable because decisions \ncan be accompanied by justifications.\n–\t It makes the ADS more acceptable from the ethical point \nof view because it preserves the autonomy of the human \ndecision maker. Indeed, even if the human decision \nmaker does not have any formal obligation to follow the \nsuggestion of the ADS, his/her autonomy is question-\nable if he/she does not have any possibility to contest it. \nBecause “contestability fosters engagement rather than \npassivity, questioning rather than acquiescence” [29], it \nis a key condition to empower human decision makers.\nSome authors have already advocated contestability by \ndesign and analyzed the challenges to be addressed to imple-\nment it [2, 13]. Opacity is often put forward as a first obsta-\ncle to the contestation of ADS-based decisions. Indeed, it is \ndifficult to contest the results of a system when information \nabout its logic, operation or input data is too scarce or not \nintelligible. The possibility to produce intelligible explana-\ntions about the results or the overall logic of an ADS is \n *\t Clément Henin \n\t\nclement.henin@inria.fr\n\t\nDaniel Le Métayer \n\t\ndaniel.le-metayer@inria.fr\n1\t\nUniv Lyon, Inria, INSA Lyon, CITI, Villeurbanne, France\n2\t\nÉcole des Ponts ParisTech, Champs‑sur‑Marne, France\n",

However, as \nstated by Mulligan et al., providing explanations is not suffi-\ncient: “regulatory approaches should seek to put profession-\nals and decision support systems in conversation, not posi-\ntion professionals as passive recipients of system wisdom \nwho must rely on out-of-system mechanisms to challenge \nthem. For these reasons, calls for explainability fall short \nand should be replaced by regulatory approaches that drive \ncontestable design” [29]. In this paper, we take the same \nstance and argue that the answer to contestations should be \njustifications and, even though the two words are sometimes \nused interchangeably, there are essential differences between \nexplanations and justifications.\nThe word “justification” itself is used with different \nmeanings in the AI literature. In this paper, we propose the \nfollowing distinctions, which are consistent with T. Miller’s \ncharacterization of justifications [24]:\n–\t The goal of an explanation is to make it possible for a \nhuman being (designer, user, affected person, etc.) to \nunderstand (a result or the whole system). In contrast, the \ngoal of a justification is to convince that the decision is \ngood. For example, an explanation for a bank loan appli-\ncation rejection could be that the number of outstanding \nloans is too high. This information helps to understand \nthe logic of the system through a salient feature used by \nthe ADS. The appropriateness of the decision is not ques-\ntioned. By contrast, a justification of the same decision \ncould be that applications with many outstanding loans \nhave a high probability to lead to credit defaults, which \nis a risk that the bank wants to reduce. Even if they often \nsupport each other, explanations and justifications have \ndifferent goals: a user can understand the logic leading to \na particular result without agreeing on the fact that this \nresult is good; vice versa, he/she may want to contest a \nresult (being convinced that it is bad) without knowing \nor understanding the logic behind the algorithm.\n–\t Explanations are descriptive and intrinsic in the sense \nthat they only depend on the system itself. In contrast, \njustifications are normative and extrinsinc in the sense \nthat they depend on a reference (or a norm) according to \nwhich the validity of the results can be assessed. Indeed, \nto claim that a result is good, it is necessary (1) to refer \nto an independent definition of what a good result is (the \nnorm) and (2) to provide evidence that this norm applies \nto the case. In the above example, the norm is the objec-\ntive of the bank to reduce credit defaults.\nIt is important to stress that the notion of norm is central \nto the challenge-justification dialectic. In general, different \ntypes of norms can be applicable to an ADS. These norms \ncan have different sources of legitimacy (legal, ethical, \nsocial, economic, etc.) and can be expressed in different \nways (e.g. through law or jurisprudence for legal norms). \nWhen several norms apply, they may be in tension, or even \nin contradiction1. In some cases, it is possible to rely on \npriority rules to establish precedence of a norm over another \none (e.g., international law usually prevails over domestic \nlaw, constitution prevails over ordinary laws, which prevail \nover decrees, etc.); in other cases, such rules may not exist \nand the conflicts between them must be solved by a human \ndecision maker on a case by case basis.\nChallenges and justifications are dual notions: a challenge \ncan be seen as a statement that a decision is not good, sup-\nported by evidence, while a justification is a statement that \na decision is good, supported by evidence. In both cases, \nevidence refers to a given norm.\nAs this discussion shows, there can be many different \nways to challenge and to justify decisions. Our main contri-\nbutions in this paper are the following:\n–\t A general definition of the notions of challenge, justifica-\ntion, norm, evidence, statement and argument.\n–\t A generic framework based on the above definitions \nincluding a challenge and justification protocol. Three \ntypes of norms are considered in this paper; they are \ninspired by the three main moral theories (virtue ethics, \nconsequentialism and deontological ethics).\n–\t A proof of concept (PoC) implementation of the frame-\nwork called Algocate and its application to a credit deci-\nsion system.\nSection 2 introduces the notions used in the paper illustrated \nwith a case study. Section 3 and Section 4 present respec-\ntively the framework and its application to the design of \nAlgocate, our challenge and justification system. Section 5 \nshows examples of our Algocate implementation applied to \na credit decision system. Section 6 is a discussion of related \nwork and Section 7 concludes with a discussion and sugges-\ntions for further research.\n2  \u0007Challenges and justifications: informal \nintroduction\nTo illustrate our framework on a concrete example, we \nintroduce an hypothetical bank credit decision system. We \nassume that this ADS relies on black-box machine learning \ntechnology. Application files are composed of information \nabout the applicant (age, gender, marital status, revenue, \nlevel of education and outstanding loans) and information \n1  In the area of ethics, the existence of incompatible commitments is \nsometimes called “moral overload” [14].\n",

These norms have different sources (fundamental \nrights, sectorial rules, business rules, etc.). The justification \nsystem provides ways to express these norms but discussions \nor debates about their legitimacy are beyond its scope. In \nfact, the justification system does not even assume that the \nlegitimacy of a norm is accepted by all parties. For example, \nin the case study considered here, the bank could refer to \ninternal business rules which are not known or accepted by \ncustomers. In such situations, if a party refers to a norm that \nis not accepted by the other party, the challenge-justification \nprotocol requires the intervention of the human decision \nmaker (called the “arbitrator” hereinafter, even if it does \nnot have to be a arbitrator in the legal sense of the term). \nThe benefit of the protocol in such cases is that a party rely-\ning on a norm is compelled to elicit it and to submit it to the \napproval of the other party (or the arbitrator as a last resort).\nFigure 2 presents an example of the interaction of a user \nwith a justification system in our framework. The statements \nof the user of the system, which are expressed in natural \nlanguage, are labelled with Ui and the system answers are \nlabelled with Ai:\n–\t In U1, the user challenges the rejection of his/her \ncredit application and expresses the reasons why he/she \nbelieves that his/her application should be accepted. \nThe user is not required to produce any evidence for \nhis/her challenge because he/she may not be in a posi-\ntion to do so (typically he/she may not have access to \nthe relevant data).\n–\t In A1, the justification system provides evidence sup-\nporting the user’s challenge. In this case, the evidence \nis generated from the learning data set of the ADS.\n–\t In A2, the justification system provides a justification \nfor the rejection decision and the evidence supporting \nit. The justification is a refinement of the challenge \nincluding an additional attribute, the number of out-\nstanding loans. The evidence is again generated from \nthe learning data set of the ADS. It shows that the num-\nber of outstanding loans of the applicant has generally \nbeen considered as a strong argument to reject similar \napplications in the past. In this case, the justification is \nconsidered stronger than the challenge because of the \nvery low ratio of accepted applications among refer-\nence decisions (5% of the decisions accepted, which is \n65% less than the average, when the difference for the \nchallenge in A1 is only 16%), while the number of 260 \ncases is reasonable. The justification system relies on \na strength relationship between arguments to decide if \na justification should prevail or not over a challenge. In \ngeneral, it may be the case that two arguments (justifi-\ncation and challenge) are not comparable. In any case, \nif two parties disagree, the final decision rests with the \narbitrator, the goal of the system being to provide the \nmost valuable information possible to help the latter in \nthis task.\nFig. 1   Examples of norms\n1. Compliance with anti-discrimination regulation: gender, ethnicity and country\nof origin should not have any impact on credit decisions.\n2. Banking prudency rule: credit amounts above 20 000 euros must be insured.\n3. Bank Objective: the number of credit defaults must be minimized.\n4. Bank Policy: ADS decisions must be consistent with the decisions made in the\npast by human banking agents, subject to compliance with Bank Objective.\nFig. 2   Example of interaction \nwith Algocate \nU1 My revenue is greater than 50 000 euros and my credit amount is lower than\n5 000 euros, so my application should be accepted.\nA1 Among the decisions used as reference by the credit decision system, there were\n2 000 applications with revenue greater than 50 000 euros and credit amount\nlower than 5 000 euros and 86 % were accepted (overall average: 70 %).\nA2 However, among the decisions used as reference by the credit decision system,\nthere were 260 applications with revenue greater than 50 000 euros, credit\namount lower than 5 000 euros and 3 or more outstanding loans (as yours) and\n5 % were accepted (overall average: 70 %).\nU2 Credit application CA2 has been accepted. This application has the same\nattributes as mine, except for the gender. Therefore, my application should be\naccepted as well.\nA3 The initial decision would indeed breach anti-discrimination regulation. Your\napplication must therefore be accepted.\n",

If he/she does \nnot, then the arbitrator has to decide whether it is accept-\nable or not. Otherwise, the user can either accept the \ndecision or challenge it in a different way. This is the \noption followed in Fig. 2: U2 challenges the decision \nbased on anti-discrimination regulation relying on a simi-\nlar application that has been accepted.\n–\t A3 is the answer produced by the justification system \nafter verification of the validity of the U2 challenge. This \nis the last step of the protocol which, in this case, does \nnot require the intervention of the arbitrator since the \nparties have agreed on a revision of the decision.\nThe interactions presented in Fig. 2 show that the frame-\nwork is useful both for users contesting the decisions of the \nADS (e.g. individuals affected by the decisions, regulators, \nor human decision makers who are not sure about the sug-\ngestion of the ADS) and for users who want to justify them \n(usually the operator of the ADS)2. The justification system \nis neutral, in the sense that it is designed to find the best \narguments (i.e. statements with evidence supporting them) \nfor both parties. This neutrality is of prime importance, \ngiven the usual imbalance of powers between individuals \nwho are affected by the decisions and the designers or opera-\ntors of the ADS.\n3  \u0007A framework to challenge and justify \ndecisions\nFigure 2 illustrates only some of the interactions provided \nby Algocate. In this section, we define more precisely the \nnotions used in this paper and introduce our framework \nbefore presenting the Algocate system, which is a particu-\nlar implementation of this framework, in the next section. \nThe framework relies on three notions that were introduced \ninformally in the previous section: statements, norms and \nevidence. Table 1 provides some examples for each of these \nnotions.\n–\t A statement defines what a decision should be (e.g. \n“accepted” or “rejected”), according to a party, and the \nparticular aspects of the case (input data of the ADS, e.g. \napplication file) that make him/her believe so.\n–\t A norm is a reference that can be used by a party to sup-\nport a statement3.\n–\t Evidence is used to show that the norm applies to the \ncase.\nA triple <statement, norm, evidence> is called an argument, \nwhich can be either a justification (if the statement supports \nthe decision) or a challenge (if the statement contradicts the \ndecision). When conflicting arguments are issued by differ-\nent parties, it is useful to be able to compare them. To this \naim, we will introduce a strength relation on arguments.\nIn the following, we define successively statements \n(Sect. 3.1), norms (Sect. 3.2), and evidence (Sect. 3.3) before \nintroducing the strength relation (Sect. 3.4).\nTable 1   Examples of statements, norms and evidence\nSTATEMENT\nAbsolute\n∀x ∈A, x[education] = PhD ∧x[outstanding-loans] ≤2\nAll cases having a PhD and less than two outstanding\n=⇒f(x) = 1\nloans should be accepted\nRelative\n∀x ∈A, (∃x′ ∈A, f(x′) = 1 ∧(x′[revenue] ≤x[revenue]\nAll cases for which there exists an accepted case with\n∧x′[amount] ≥x[amount])) =⇒f(x) = 1\nlower revenue and greater amount should be accepted\nNORM\nRule\n[Rule, ∀x ∈A, x[outstanding-loans] ≥4 =⇒f(x) = 0]\nCredit with four or more outstanding loans should be rejected\n(absolute)\nRule\n[Rule, ∀x ∈A, (∃x′ ∈A, f(x′) = 1 ∧(x′[revenue] = x[revenue]\nAll cases for which there exists an accepted case with the same\n(relative)\n∧x′[education] = x[education] ∧x′[age] ≥x[age])) =⇒f(x) = 1]\neducation level and revenue and higher age, should be accepted\nObjective\n[Obj, ∆O, nd]\nThe number of accepted non-default cases should be maximised\n(with x[nd] = 1 for non-default cases and x[nd] = 0 otherwise)\n(the number of defaults should be minimised)\nReference\n[Ref, ∆R, d]\nThe decisions of the ADS should reﬂect the decisions\n(with x[d] the reference decision for a case x)\nmade in the past by the bank experts\nEVIDENCE\nObjective\n[∆O, 1200, 0.06](i)\nThe non-default rate for the 1200 historical credits\nwhere ∆O is the historical database with the objective attribute x[o]\ncorresponding to the statement is 93 % (overall average: 87 %)\nReference\n[∆R, 500, 0.28](ii)\nAmong the 500 past experts decisions corresponding\nwhere ∆R is the reference database with the reference attribute x[d]\nto the statement, 95 % were accepted (overall average: 67 %)\n(i) The value 0.06 is the result of the difference 0.93–0.87\n(ii) The value 0.28 is the result of the difference 0.95–0.67\n2  In Fig. 2, U1 and U2 are contestations while A2 is a justification of \nthe decision.\n3  As suggested in Sect. 2, Algocate is agnostic about the source and \nthe legitimacy of a norm.\n",

The set of possible values for attribute aj is \ndenoted 퐀퐣 and 퐀= 퐀ퟏ× ⋯× 퐀퐦 is the set of all possi-\nble cases. The decision function is called f ∶퐀→픹 with \n픹= {0, 1} (we assume that decisions are binary). We use \nthe notation x[j] to refer to the jth attribute of x ∈퐀 . There-\nfore, x[j] ∈퐀퐣 . The notation is extended to sets S of cases \nwith S[j] = {x[j]|x ∈S} . For the sake of readability, we use \nconstant names such as “amount” or “duration” rather than \nindexes in examples. For instance, if the third field of a case \nx represents the amount of a credit, we write x[amount] to \ndenote it (with amount = 3 ). The case under consideration \nis called xs ∈퐀.\n3.1  \u0007Statements\nAs suggested in the previous section, statements involve two \npieces of information:\n–\t The decision that should be made, according to the issuer \nof the statement (1 for “accepted” or 0 for “rejected”) and\n–\t The property of the case that argues in favour of this \ndecision, according to the issuer of the statement.\nIn mathematical terms, statements are, therefore, defined as \nfollows:\nwith 훿∈픹 the decision supported by the issuer and C(x) \nthe property supposed to justify this decision. A statement \nis relevant for a case xs only if C(xs) is true, which will be \nassumed thereafter. If 훿≠f(xs) , the goal of the statement is \nto contest the decision. We call it a challenging statement. \nVice versa, if 훿= f(xs) , the goal of the statement is to sup-\nport the decision. We call it a justifying statement.\nIn general, C(x) could involve comparisons of x with any \nnumber of other cases. For the sake of simplicity, we con-\nsider only two options here: conditions involving zero or one \nother case. The definitions can be easily generalized to any \nnumber of other cases4.\nThe first type of statements, called absolute statements, \ndoes not refer to any other case. Examples of absolute state-\nments appear in the first interaction step (U1) of Fig. 2 and in \nthe first line of Table 1. The general form of condition C(x) \nfor absolute statements is the following:\n(1)\n∀x ∈퐀, C(x) ⟹f(x) = 훿\n(2)\nC(x) = (x[i1]♢1v1) ∧⋯∧(x[ik]♢kvk)\nwith ip ∈{1, … , m} , ♢p ∈{=, ≤, <, ≥, >} for p in {1, … , k} \nand vp ∈퐀퐢퐩 . The first line of Table 1 provides an example \nof condition expressed in this syntax.\nIn contrast, relative statements involve a comparison with \nanother case x′ . The second user interaction (U2) of Fig. 2 \nand the second line of Table 1 are examples of relative state-\nments. More formally, condition C(x) for relative statements \nhas the following form:\nwith for all p in {1, … , k} , ip ∈{1, … , m} , \n♢p ∈{=, ≤, <, ≪, ≥, >, ≫} . Operators ≪ and ≫ , which \nstand for, respectively, “much less than” and “much greater \nthan”, are defined as follows: x ≪y ⇔x + k ≤y and \nx ≫y ⇔x ≥y + k with k an application-dependent param-\neter. The statement corresponds to a situation in which \nanother case x′ is associated with a decision 훿 and the rela-\ntion between the two cases would justify that the same deci-\nsion is made for x. The second line of Table 1 provides an \nexample of condition expressed in this syntax.\n3.2  \u0007Norms\nAs discussed in the introduction, in order to challenge or to \njustify a decision it is necessary that a statement is backed by \nan applicable norm. We consider three types of norms here, \ncalled respectively rule-based, objective-based and refer-\nence-based norms, which correspond to three typical ways \nto support a challenge (or a justification). Interestingly, these \nthree modes also reflect the approaches followed by the three \nmain families of moral theories (respectively deontological \nethics, consequentialism and virtue ethics). Other types of \nnorms can be easily added to the framework, provided that \ntheir meaning is defined precisely, as done in this section, \nand their strength is characterized as done in Sect. 3.4.\nRule-based norms\nExamples of rule-based norms expressed in an informal \nway can be found in the first two lines of Fig. 1. As the name \nsuggests, a rule-based norm is defined by a fixed rule. For-\nmally speaking, these rules can be expressed as:\nwith Rule a flag defining the type of the norm and Def its \ncontent. Def is expressed in the same language as statements, \nthat is, definition (1) of Sect. 3.1 with C defined by Eq. (2) \nif the norm is expressed in terms of a single case (absolute \n(3)\nC(x) = ∃x\u001b ∈퐀, f(x\u001b) = 훿\n∧\n(x\u001b[i1]♢1x[i1]) ∧⋯∧(x\u001b[ik]♢kx[ik])\n[Rule, Def]\n4  We have not encounetred any practical situation in which such gen-\neralization would be useful, though.\n",

Lines \n3 and 4 of Table 1 show respectively an example of absolute \nrule (business rule) and an example of relative rule.\nThis type of norm is common, inter alia, in law (regula-\ntions, directives, acts, contractual rules, etc.) and business \n(sectorial rules, corporate rules, procedural rules, etc.). In \nterms of moral theories, it is also the spirit of deontological \nethics5 which relies on moral obligations (such as “Thou \nShalt Not Tell Lies”) that must be followed by any rational \nagent [33].\nObjective-based norms\nThe second way to define a norm consists of using meas-\nurable objectives that can be used to assess decisions. The \nthird line of Fig. 1 shows an informal example of objective-\nbased norm. In formal terms, an objective is expressed as an \nattribute that should be maximised6. In Fig. 1, this attribute \nis the number of non-default cases for Bank Objective.\nFormally speaking, objective-based norms can be \nexpressed as\nwhere Obj is a flag defining the type of the norm, 훥O a data-\nbase containing the values 훥O[ob] of the objective attribute \nob. Line 5 of Table 1 shows an example of objective-based \nnorm.\nObjective-based norms are common in business and \norganizations in general. In terms of moral theories, they \ncan be related to consequentialism, which, as stated by Mark \nTimmons “explains the deontic status of actions and other \nitems of moral evaluations entirely in terms of the values of \nthe consequences of actions and other items being morally \nevaluated”. Even if we do not restrict the scope of norms \nto moral issues, as shown in the examples, objective-based \nnorms follow the same approach as consequentialism in the \nsense that, rather than relying on fixed rules (as rule-based \nnorms and deontological ethics), they focus on the assess-\nment of the impact of the decisions.\nReference-based norms\nThe third type of norm is illustrated by Bank Policy in \nFig. 1. This type of norm is applicable when reference data \n훥R about past decisions is available. The principle in this \ncase is that the decisions are justified if they are consist-\nent with past decisions. The implicit assumption is that the \nreference data is valid or legitimate, in the sense that it can \nbe used as a model for future decisions. This assumption \n[Obj, 훥O, ob]\ncan actually be disputed when a decision is challenged, as \ndiscussed in Sect. 4.\nFormally speaking, reference-based norms can be \nexpressed as\nwhere Ref is a flag defining the type of the norm, 훥R a data-\nbase containing the values 훥R[d] of the decision attribute \nd. Line 6 of Table 1 shows an example of reference-based \nnorm.\nThis type of norm is common in law (use of previous \ncases or jurisprudence). In terms of moral theories, they can \nbe related to virtue ethics, which is introduced as follows by \nMark Timmons: “We often look to others as models for the \ntype of person we would like to be because we think they \npossess certain admirable character traits.” Indeed, we can \nsee the reference data as a model of “good behaviour” (here \na model for “good decisions”), the goal of the ADS being \nto mirror as closely as possible the behaviour of this model. \nWhen an ADS relies on supervised machine learning, the \nlearning data set can obviously be used as the reference data.\n3.3  \u0007Evidence\nIn an argument <statement, norm, evidence>, the evidence \ncomponent shows how the statement is supported by the \nnorm. Evidence can take different forms depending on the \ntype of the norm. Actually, the main difference is between:\n–\t On the one hand, rule-based norms, which do not rely on \ndatabases: they either support or do not support a state-\nment (binary stance).\n–\t On the other hand, objective-based norms and reference-\nbased norms, which rely on databases and can be sup-\nported by quantitative evidence. A statement can be more \nor less supported by such norms.\nThe case for rule-based norms is simple since these norms \nare expressed in the same language as statements. A \nstatement:\nis supported by a rule:\nif and only if:\nwhich can be derived using a simple inference system com-\nparing term by term the (x[ij]♢jvj) components of Cs and Cr.\nEvidence involving objective-based norms and refer-\nence-based norms relies on two numerical values called \n[Ref, 훥R, d]\n(4)\n∀x ∈퐀, Cs(x) ⟹f(x) = 훿s\n(5)\n∀x ∈퐀, Cr(x) ⟹f(x) = 훿r\n(6)\n훿s = 훿r ∧∀x ∈퐀, (Cs(x) ⟹Cr(x))\n5  The main representative of this school of thought is Kant’s moral \ntheory.\n6  Of course, it is also possible to express minimisation by consider-\ning the opposite of the relevant attribute.\n",

If the state-\nment is defined by:\nand 훥 is the relevant dataset (either 훥O or 훥R ), we first \ndefine 훥|C , the subset of cases matching the condition of \nthe statement:\nThe coverage 훾(훥, C) is defined as follows:\nwith card(S) the cardinal of a set S.\nFor objective feature ob, the deviation 휇(훥, C, 훿) is \ndefined as follows:\nwith S the average of the values of the set S. The deviation \n휇 measures the difference of averages between the subset \ncharacterized by C and the whole population. The factor \n(2훿−1) is justified as follows. If the difference is positive \n(objective higher in 훥|C ) then the evidence supports state-\nments such that 훿= 1 and negates statements such that \n훿= 0 . Vice versa, if the difference is negative (objective \nlower in 훥|C ) then the evidence supports statements 훿= 0 \nand negates statements with 훿= 1 . For the sake of read-\nability, it is preferable to show to the user both the subset \naverage 훥|C[ob] and the population average 훥[ob] as done in \nTable 1. The deviation for reference-based norms is defined \nin the same way.\nThe full definition of evidence is the following:\nwith 훥 the relevant dataset ( 훥O or 훥R ). The last two lines of \nTable 1 show examples of evidence for an objective-based \nnorm and a reference-based norm. As suggested above, \ndata-based evidence can be more or less supporting. For \ninstance, in the last line of Table 1, the statement character-\nizes a subset of size 500 with an average number of accepted \napplications 28 % higher than the whole population (95 % \n−67% = 28% ). In this case, the argument is strong because \nboth the coverage (500) and the deviation (0.28) are high, \nbut it is not the case for the penultimate line of Table 1 in \nwhich the deviation is only 0.06. We discuss further the \nnotion of strength in the next section.\nWe consider only well-formed arguments here, that is, \narguments < S, N, E > such that E supports, to some extent, \nS. More precisely, if N is a rule-based norm, then argument \n< S, N, E > is well-formed only if Condition (6) is met. If N \nis a data-based norm, it is well-formed only if 훾(훥, C) ≠0 \nand 𝜇(𝛥, C, 𝛿) > 0.\n(7)\n∀x ∈퐀, C(x) ⟹f(x) = 훿\n(8)\n훥|C = {x ∈훥|C(x)}\n(9)\n훾(훥, C) = card(훥|C)\n(10)\n휇(훥, C, 훿) = (2훿−1)(훥|C[ob] −훥[ob])\n(11)\n[훥, 훾(훥, C), 휇(훥, C, 훿)]\n3.4  \u0007Strength relation\nWhen two parties disagree about a decision and each party \nprovides an argument to support his/her position, it is impor-\ntant to be able to compare these arguments. To this aim, \nwe define a preorder relation7 ⩾a between arguments. This \nrelation (hereafter “strength relation”) is defined in terms of \nthe components of the arguments:\nIn other terms, an argument A is stronger than an argument \nA′ in two cases:\n–\t A relies on a stronger norm than A′ or\n–\t A and A′ rely on the same norm but A’s evidence is \nstronger than A′ ’s evidence.\nThis generic definition can be complemented, on a case by \ncase basis, depending on the context.8\nThe strength relation ⩾n between norms is essentially \ndomain-dependent and it has to be defined for each applica-\ntion. As an illustration, in the example of Fig. 1, the bank \nhas specified an explicit strength relation between two norms \n(Bank Objective ⩾n Bank Policy). In addition, the first norm, \nwhich is a fundamental right, is stronger than all the oth-\ners. It should be clear that the strength relation is partial: \nthere are situations in which two applicable norms are not \ncomparable. We come back to this issue in the next section.\nAs far as ⩾e is concerned, it is only relevant for data-based \nevidence, since rule-based evidence is not quantitative. A \nsimple way to define it for objective-based norms could be \nthe following:\nLarge coverages lead to stronger arguments because they \nimprove the statistical significance of the evidence. The \nstrength of the evidence also grows with 휇 because higher \nvalues of 휇 correspond to more supportive objective values \nor reference decisions. This definition of ⩾e is intuitive but \nit is conservative in the sense that it leads to a great number \nof incomparable pieces of evidence. A more sophisticated \ndefinition is proposed in the next section.\n(12)\n[S, N, E] ⩾a [S\u001d, N\u001d, E\u001d]\n⇔(N ⩾n N\u001d) ∨((N = N\u001d) ∧(E ⩾e E\u001d))\n(13)\n[훥, 훾, 휇] ⩾e [훥, 훾\u001d, 휇\u001d] ⇔(훾≥훾\u001d ∧휇≥휇\u001d)\n7  Binary relation that is reflexive and transitive.\n8  See Sect. 4 for an example.\n",

In this section, we sketch the main choices \nmade in the design of Algocate, our proof-of-concept imple-\nmentation. We first describe in Sect. 4.1 the main steps of \nthe interaction protocol, which shows the functionalities \nprovided by the system. Then, we define more precisely the \nstrength relation used in Algocate in Sect. 4.2 and its use for \nthe generation of statements in Sect. 4.3 .\n4.1  \u0007The Algocate protocol\nAn Algocate session is always associated with a decision, \nwhich is called the initial decision in the sequel. The user \ncan be any stakeholder or party concerned by the ADS \n(designer, operator, human decision maker, person affected \nby the decision, auditor, etc.) and his/her motivation can be \nvaried, for example to find arguments to support the initial \ndecision, to contest it or to enhance his/her trust9. We also \nassume that, in case of disagreement, final decisions are \nalways taken by a human agent (called the arbitrator in this \npaper). Last but not least, we assume that a set of norms and \nevidence have been supplied to Algocate by the stakeholders \nand/or by independent third parties (e.g. regulation bodies). \nHowever, no assumption is made neither about the compre-\nhensiveness of this initial set of information nor about the \nfact that all users will necessarily accept these norms. As \nshown below, this set of information may evolve, in particu-\nlar to take into account the verdicts of the arbitrator. \n1.\t The interaction with Algocate starts with an initial state-\nment (called the user statement) by a user. If the user has \na specific norm in mind to support his/her statement, he/\nshe can also provide it, but this information is not man-\ndatory. In the following, we consider the most common \n(and most complex) situation in which the only input to \nthe system is a user statement.\n2.\t Algocate analyses the user statement and searches for \nappropriate norms and evidence to generate the strong-\nest well-formed argument(s) supporting this statement. \nSince the strength relation is not total, some arguments \nmay not be comparable. In such cases, Algocate returns \nseveral arguments. The strength relation used by Algo-\ncate is defined in Sect. 4.2.\n3.\t The next step for Algocate is to try to reinforce the user \nstatement to find stronger arguments. At this stage, \nAlgocate adopts a neutral position and considers both \narguments supporting the initial decision and argu-\nments challenging it. Algocate returns the strongest \nwell-formed arguments based on these new statements \n(called generated statements). The generation of state-\nments is described more precisely in Sect. 4.3.\nSeveral options are possible for the user at this stage. The \nmost interesting situation is the case of the user whose goal \nis to challenge the initial decision:\n–\t If Algocate has generated strong evidence supporting the \nstatement of the user (in Step (2) or Step (3)), then he/\nshe can provide this evidence to the arbitrator to request \na revision of the initial decision.\n–\t If Algocate has generated stronger evidence against the \nstatement of the user (in Step (3)), then the user can \neither be convinced that the initial decision is legitimate \nor not. In the first case, the protocol stops since the disa-\ngreement has been solved. In the second case, the first \noption for the user is to try to challenge the decision on \na different basis (with a new statement), trigerring a new \niteration of the protocol. The second option, if he/she \nbelieves that the argument generated by Algocate is not \nlegitimate, is to submit it to the arbitrator. This can be \nthe case, for instance, if the argument relies on a norm \nwhich is not accepted by the user. Typical examples \ncan be biased reference data or norms corresponding to \ncorporate rules that are not known by customers. If the \narbitrator confirms that the norm is not acceptable, the \nimpact of his/her verdict goes beyond the decision chal-\nlenged by the user: the operator of the ADS must modify \nthe system to correct the situation (and the set of norms \nused by Algocate should be updated accordingly).\n4.2  \u0007Strength relation\nThe strength relation used to compare arguments should \nmeet two criteria: it should reflect the intuition of the par-\nties (and the intuition of the arbitrator) and it should make \nit possible to compare all (or most) arguments. These two \ncriteria can be in tension, as shown in Sect. 3.4 which intro-\nduces a simple and intuitive relation that leaves many argu-\nments incomparable. To solve this tension, Algocate relies \non a score function t measuring the strength of data-based \nevidence such that:\nIntuitively, evidence is strong if the deviation is high, mean-\ning that condition C has a strong impact on the average. \n(14)\n[훥, 훾, 휇] ⩾e [훥, 훾\u001d, 휇\u001d] ⇔t(훥, 훾, 휇) ≥t(훥, 훾\u001d, 휇\u001d)\n(15)\nt(훥, 훾, 휇) = 휇\n√\n훾\n9  For the avoidance of doubt, Algocate users may challenge or justify \ndecisions of an ADS, not the outcomes of Algocate itself.\n",

For instance, evidence involving a \nset of only two reference cases should be considered weaker \nthan evidence relying on a subset of one hundred reference \ncases (if their deviations are close). To take this factor into \naccount, it is a common practice to compare the average \nvalue of 훥|C[o] with the expected average value of a random \ndrawing of the same size. From the law of large numbers, \nwe know that the expected standard deviation of this ran-\ndomly drawn subset is proportional to 1∕√훾 .

We do not discuss them further \nin this paper for the sake of conciseness.\n4.3  \u0007Generation of statements\nFor a neutral challenge and justification system, it is not suf-\nficient to generate evidence to support the statement issued \nby the user. As shown in Fig. 2, the fact that this statement \nis supported by some evidence does not mean that a stronger \nargument cannot be found to support either the same posi-\ntion or the opposite.\nThe objective of Algocate statement generation proce-\ndure is illustrated by Fig. 3. The left side of the figure (a) \nshows the historical data set 훥 with the initial decision in \nred and the statement of the user (stating that the decisions \nin the orange hatched area, which represents 훥|C , should \nbe 1). This statement is weakly supported by the dataset. \nThe middle part of figure (b) shows a stronger argument \nsupporting the same conclusion (with an additional condi-\ntion represented by the horizontal bar). However, the right \nside of figure (c) shows an even stronger argument against \nthe statement of the user (represented by the two vertical \nbars). This is indeed the strongest argument according to the \nstrength relation ≥e defined in the previous section, which is \nconsistent with the intuition since the size of the selected set \nis approximately similar but the ratio of negative decisions \nis much higher than the ratio of positive decisions in (b).\nMore precisely, the goal of the search procedure is to find \nconditions C∗ and conclusion 훿 (0 or 1) such that: \n1.\t the generated statement includes the initial decision xs : \nC∗(xs) is true,\n2.\t the generated statement strengthens the initial statement: \n∀x, C∗(x) ⟹C(x),\n3.\t the evidence supporting this statement is maximal: \nt(훥, 훾∗, 휇∗) is maximized.\nwith 훾∗= 훾(훥, C∗) and 휇∗= 휇(훥, C∗, 훿).\nComing back to Fig. 3, we can see that all hatched areas \ninclude the initial decision (red point) and strengthen the \ninitial statement (the vertical line in (a) is reused in (b) and \n(c)). Also, we see intuitively that a strong statement should \ncover as many corroborating data points as possible (many \norange points in Fig. 3b and purple points in Fig. 3c).\nThe benefit of generating statements that strengthen \nthe argument of the user is to ensure that the answers of \nthe system take into account the concern of the user. This \ncustomization makes the interaction more constructive and \ninsightful.

It contains \ninformation about credit applications (credit amount, savings \nstatus, etc.) and the conclusions of the bank experts (low risk \nor high risk). Table  2 shows the values of attributes used in \nthe examples presented in this section. We trained a random \nforest classifier on 훥G to build an ADS predicting the conclu-\nsions of the bank experts.\nWe use three norms N1 , N2 and N3 for this case study, with \nN1 ≥n N2 ≥n N3:\n–\t N1 (rule-based norm):\n\t\n ∀x ∈A, x[savings_status] = “no savings” ⟹f(x) = 0\n–\t N2 (reference-based norm): 훥G should be used as a refer-\nence dataset with decision the reference attribute.\n–\t N3 (objective-based norm): 훥G should be used as a objec-\ntive dataset with the opposite of the duration attribute \nused as the objective. The strategy of the bank is to \nfavour credits with short durations to reduce the risk of \ndefaults and to foster short term profits.\nThe value of an objective attribute cannot be known at the \ntime of the decision as it should be a consequence of the \ndecision used to assess its impact.

The computation time on \na laptop was of the order of few seconds for each example.\n5.1  \u0007Example 1\nThis first example illustrates the ability of Algocate to gen-\nerate “optimised” statements. Here, the user is a customer \nwhose credit application file A has been rejected and who \nwants to challenge the decision. The user happens to know \nanother application A′ that has been accepted and uses it in \nhis/her statement (which is therefore a relative statement). \nThe values of the features corresponding to user A and user \nA′ are presented in Table 2.

The interactions \nshown in Fig. 4 follow the three steps of the protocol pre-\nsented in Sect. 4.1: statement of the user (U1), argument \ngenerated by Algocate for this statement (A1) and a stronger \nargument (based on a new statement generated by Algocate) \nsupporting the same position. At the end of the interaction, \nthe customer is in a better position to challenge the decision \n(for example with the bank or in court).\n5.2  \u0007Example 2\nThe second example shows how Algocate can be used by \ndifferent parties to challenge or to support a given decision. \nHere, the first party is a customer whose application has \nbeen rejected and who disagrees with the decision and the \nsecond party is a banking agent who is asked to justify the \ndecision.\nThe customer issues a challenging statement and obtains \nan argument with strong objective-based evidence (Fig. 5). \nLet us assume that the customer decides to contest the deci-\nsion with this argument in front of the bank.

Assuming that this argument is \nstronger than the customer’s argument generated in Fig. 5, \nthe customer can either accept the decision (for example, if \nhe/she realizes that N1 is imposed by law) or decide to chal-\nlenge it (for example, if N1 is an internal rule of the bank that \ndoes not reflect common practice). If the verdict of the arbi-\ntrator is in favour of the customer, the operator of the ADS \nshould modify in to take this decision into account and the \nnorm database of Algocate should be updated accordingly.\n6  \u0007Related work\nIn the field of explainable AI, the distinction between \nexplanations and justifications is sometimes blurred. In \nsome papers [20], justifications are seen as ways to make \nunderstandable the inner operations of a complex system, \nwhich would be called white-box explanations according to \nour definitions. Similarly, [8, 9] make a distinction between \n“how did the system arrive at the prediction” and “why \nshould we believe the prediction is correct” but they do not \nrefer to any external norm, and therefore provide explana-\ntions (based on narrative roles explaining the effect of the \nfeatures of the input data used by the system) rather than \njustifications in our sense. Another distinction is made by \nKlass and Finin [16] based on the intention, which should be \nto “produce knowledge in the hearer” for explanations and \n“to affect the beliefs of the hearer” for justifications. From a \ndifferent perspective, [10], introduces a classification of jus-\ntifications in machine learning related to the performances \n(accuracy) of the systems.\nA series of works [7, 24, 28] refer to justifications as ways \nof ensuring that a decision is good (in contrast to under-\nstanding a decision), which is in line with the approach fol-\nlowed in this paper and definitions of explanations and jus-\ntifications in philosophy [3]. Regarding the extrinsic nature \nof explanation, [31] distinguishes between justifications and \nexplanations based on the origin of the information they \nrefer to: explanations describe how the system works while \njustifications use domain knowledge to show that decisions \nare correct. The normative nature of justifications has also \nbeen pointed out in the field of intelligent systems [18]: “an \nintelligent system exhibits justified agency if it follows soci-\nety’s norms and explains its activities in those terms”. In \n[19], the authors qualify explanations as “unjustified” when \nthere are not supported by training data, which is related \nto our notion of justification with reference-based norms \n(Sect. 3.2). However, in this context justifiability applies to \nexplanations rather than to the decisions themselves.\nThe term “justification” is sometimes used in the field \nof autonomous agents to refer to motivations to perform a \nspecific action. The main difference with our approach is \nthat norms are made available to autonomous agents to make \ntheir decisions. For example, the framework introduced in \n[21] relies on norms (called “principles”) inferred from \nethical judgments using inductive logic programming. In a \nnutshell, a value-driven agent refers to an ethical preference \nordering of the actions before making any decision. Justifica-\ntions of the decisions can be built using assumption-based \nargumentation with deductive rules representing the accept-\nance of different ethical consequences. It is worth noting \nthat it is appropriate to present justifications as a type of \nexplanation in this context since norms are internalised. Our \napproach is complementary to this trend of work in the sense \nthat it is not limited to norms expressed in terms of rules and \nsituations in which all choices can be automated.\nFinally, closer to our approach, [22] criticizes “anorma-\ntive” explanations and calls for the explicit definition of \nalgorithm “goals” that should be understandable. These \ngoals being defined, a decision is justified when the “evi-\ndence” that it meets the goals can be provided. However, \nunlike the framework proposed in this paper, goals must be \ndefined in advance and included in the design objectives of \nthe system. Also the possibility to contest a decision based \non these goals is not mentioned. In the same spirit, but at \nanother level, [32] uses a refinement structure to provide \njustifications about the decisions made during the design \nof the system.\nThe need to design systems that are contestable has been \npointed out by several authors recently. For instance [2] calls \nfor systems that are “contestable by design”. In [30], the \nauthors show the importance of being able to challenge algo-\nrithmic decisions or recommendation systems in the field of \nmedicine.\nThe interest for more interactive machine learning sys-\ntems manifests in a variety of ways [1]. The need to conceive \nexplanations as an interactive process has been argued by \nseveral authors [25, 27]. The “human-in-the-loop” approach \nleverages on human feedback during the training process to \nobtain more accurate classifiers [17]. A lot of work has also \nbeen done on argumentation and dialog games [4, 5, 23] \nbut the focus in these areas is generally the logical struc-\nture of the framework to express and to relate arguments \nor the protocol to exchange arguments. In contrast, we take \nFig. 6   Interaction initiated by \nthe banking agent to justify the \ndecision\nU1 A savings status value is equal to “no savings”, so A should be rejected.\nA1 This statement is supported by the rule-based norm N1.\n",

However, the goal of this work is \nto “align an agent’s actions with the values and preferences \nof humans”, which is seen as a “training-time problem”. \nOur objective in this paper was different but an interesting \navenue for further research could be the application of our \napproach to design or to improve an ADS.\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of these contributions \nhas led to the proposal of a framework or a tool to challenge \nand to justify decisions comparable to the work presented \nin this paper.\n7  \u0007Conclusion\nThe ultimate goal of the work presented in this paper is to \nimprove the integration of algorithmic decision tools in the \noverall decision making process and ensure that they can be \nused for the benefit of people relying on them or affected by \ntheir decisions. As stated in Sect. 2, Algocate is neutral, in \nthe sense that it is designed to find the best arguments for \nboth parties. Ideally, this type of system should be certified \nand made available to all parties. We also emphasize that \nthe framework presented here is not intended to replace a \nhuman decision maker but to put him/her in the best posi-\ntion to make a decision. It can also be useful to better justify \ndecisions and to reconcile the viewpoints of the parties.\nA system like Algocate is also a contribution to account-\nability, which has been pointed out as a key and complex \nissue for ADS [6, 11]. For example, [6] states that “anyone \ndeploying algorithmic models inevitably also engages a set \nof normative principles (at least implicitly)” and “account-\nability involves the provision of reasons, explanations and \njustifications and this ought to involve drawing out these \nimplicit epistemic and normative standards”. As such, Algo-\ncate could complement proposals such as model cards [26] \n(which can be used to provide information about a machine-\nlearning model, such as its intended use, metrics to assess \nit potential impacts, training data, evaluation data, quantita-\ntive analyses, etc.) and datasheets for datasets [26] (which \ncan be used to describe the characteristics of a dataset) in \norder to provide an interactive and easily accessible form of \naccountability.\nWe believe that this kind of system is most welcome \nin situations in which the stakes are high (e.g. in the health-\ncare or justice sectors) and the requirements of the ADS are \nnot entirely formalized or cannot be guaranteed by design. \nThis may be the case for various reasons, for example when \nrequirements involve ethical aspects, or legal aspects leaving \nroom for interpretation, or evolving constraints (e.g. pro-\ncedures or regulations), or technical aspects which are not \nprone to formal definitions (e.g. image or text analysis). As \nan illustration, the legal constraints applicable to a given \nsystem are rarely formalized before its development16. A \nsystem like Algocate makes it possible to provide, indepen-\ndently from the design of the ADS and incrementally, the \nmaterial (norms and evidence) useful to justify decisions. \nWe hold that this contribution is a first step to address the \ncall expressed in [12] “for tangible action to move from \nhigh-level abstractions and conceptual arguments towards \napplying ethics in practice and creating accountability \nmechanisms.”\nAs far as further work is concerned, Algocate should be \ntested through randomized user studies involving different \ntypes of users in order to prove its usability in real life. We \nplan to carry out these experiments in the near future in col-\nlaboration with partners in the public sector (tax authorities) \nand the private sector (insurance companies).\nAs stated in the introduction, our framework works in a \nblack-box mode, in the sense that no assumption is made \nabout the internals of the ADS. As a result, it may also be \nuseful to justify or contest decisions made by human beings \n(without the help of an ADS). Further work is needed to \nassess the relevance of Algocate in this context.\nAuthor contributions  The authors contributed to the manuscript \nequally.\nFunding  The research was supported by Inria and École des Ponts \nParis- Tech.\nDeclarations \nConflict of interest  The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Abdul, A., Vermeulen, J., Wang, D., Lim, B.Y., Kankanhalli, M.: \nTrends and trajectories for explainable, accountable and intelligi-\nble systems: an HCI research agenda.

At least two differences characterize the \npresent climate. First, as is widely remarked, a vast increase in computational power \nand access to training data has led to practical breakthroughs in machine learning, a \nsingularly important branch of AI.9 These breakthroughs underpin recent successes \nacross a variety of applied domains, from diagnosing precancerous moles to driving \na vehicle, and dramatize the potential of AI for both good and ill.  \n \nSecond, policymakers are finally paying close attention. In 1960, when John F. \nKennedy was elected, there were calls for him to hold a conference around robots \nand labor.10 He declined.11  Later there were calls to form a Federal Automation \nCommission.12 None was formed. I looked and found no hearings on artificial \nintelligence in the House or Senate until, within months of one another in 2016, the \nHouse Energy and Commerce held a hearing on Advanced Robotics (robots with AI) \nand the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held the “first \never hearing focused solely on artificial intelligence.”13 That same year, the Obama \nWhite House held four workshops on AI and published three official reports \ndetailing its findings.14 Formal policymaking around AI abroad is, if anything, more \nadvanced: the governments of Japan and the European Union have formed official \ncommissions around robots and AI in recent years.15  \n                                                        \n7 Peter Stone et al., Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, Stanford University (Sept. 2016), \nhttps://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai_100_report_0831fnl.pdf.  \n8 Id., at 50. \n9 Id., at 13.

This essay is meant to be a roadmap, not the \nroad itself. Its primary goal is to point the new entrant toward a wider debate and \nequip her or him with the context for further exploration and research.  \n \nI am a law professor with no formal training in AI.

Part III addresses the oddly tenacious and \nprevalent fear that AI poses an existential threat to humanity—a concern that, if \ntrue, would seem to dwarf all other policy concerns. A final section concludes.  \n \nThank you for reading this essay. Your thoughts are warmly welcome.  \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \nWhat is AI?  \n \nThere is no straightforward, consensus definition of artificial intelligence. AI is best \nunderstood as a set of techniques aimed at approximating some aspect of human or \nanimal cognition using machines. Early theorists conceived of symbolic systems—\nthe organization of abstract symbols using logical rules—as the most fruitful path \ntoward computers that can “think.”18 But the approach of building a reasoning \nmachine upon which to scaffold all other cognitive tasks, as originally envisioned by \nTuring and others, did not deliver upon initial expectations. What seems possible in \ntheory has yet to yield many viable applications in practice.19 \n \nSome blame an over-commitment to symbolic systems relative to other available \ntechniques (e.g., reinforcement learning) for the dwindling of research funding in \nthe late 1980s known as the AI Winter.20 Regardless, as limitations to the capacity of \n“good old fashioned AI” to deliver practical applications became apparent, \nresearchers pursued a variety of other approaches to approximating cognition \ngrounded in the analysis and manipulation of real world data.21 An important \nconsequence of the shift was that researchers began to try to solve specific \nproblems or master particular “domains,” such as converting speech to text or \nplaying chess, instead of pursuing a holistic intelligence capable of performing every \ncognitive task within one system.22 \n                                                                                                                                                                     \nthe beginning and not the end of public discussion.” Id. I vehemently agree. For another \ninterpretation, focusing on careers in AI policy, see Miles Brundage, Guide to working in AI policy and \nstrategy, 80,000 Hours (2017), https://80000hours.org/articles/ai-policy-guide/.  \n18 Stone et al., supra note 7.  \n19 Id.  \n20 Id. See also supra, note 9, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence. \n21 Stone et al., supra note 7.  \n22 Originally the community drew a distinction between “weak” or “narrow” AI, designed to solve a \nsingle problem like chess, and “strong” AI with human-like capabilities across the boards. Today the \nterm strong AI has given way to terms like artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refer to systems \nthat can accomplish tasks in more than one domain without necessarily mastering all cognitive tasks.   \n",

Much of the contemporary \nexcitement around AI, however, flows from the enormous promise of a particular \nset of techniques known collectively as machine learning.23 Machine learning or ML \nrefers to the capacity of a system to improve its performance at a task over time.24 \nOften this task involves recognizing patterns in datasets, although ML outputs can \ninclude everything from translating languages and diagnosing precancerous moles \nto grasping objects or helping to drive a car. As I allude to just above, most every \ntechnique that underpins ML have been around for decades. The recent explosion of \nefficacy comes from a combination of much faster computers and much more data.  \n \nIn other words, AI is an umbrella term, comprised by many different techniques. \nToday’s cutting-edge practitioners tend to emphasize approaches such as deep \nlearning within ML that leverage many-layered structures to extract features from \nenormous data sets in service of practical tasks requiring pattern recognition, or use \nreinforcement learning or convex optimization to similar effect. As we will see, these \ngeneral features of contemporary AI—the shift toward practical applications, for \nexample, and the reliance on data—also inform our policy questions.  \n \nWhere is AI developed and deployed? \n \nDevelopment of AI is most advanced within industry, academia, and the military.25 \nIndustry in particular is taking the lead on AI, with tech companies hiring away top \nscientists from universities and leveraging unparalleled access to enormous \ncomputational power and voluminous, timely data.26 This was not always the case: \nas with many technologies, AI had its origins in academic research catalyzed by \nconsiderable military funding.27 But industry has long held a significant role. The AI \nWinter gave way to the present AI Spring in part thanks to the continued efforts of \nresearchers at Xerox Park and Bell Labs. Even today, much of the AI research \noccurring at firms is happening in research departments structurally insulated, to \nsome degree, from the demands of the company’s bottom line. Still, it is worth \nnoting that as few as seven for profit institutions—Google, Facebook, IBM, Amazon, \n                                                        \n23 See supra, note 9, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence. \n24 Harry Surden, Machine Learning and the Law, 89 Washington Law Review 87, 89-90 (2014). \n25 There are other, private organizations and public labs with considerable acumen in artificial \nintelligence, including the Allen Institute for AI and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). \n26 E.g., Jordan Pearson, Uber’s AI Hub in Pittsburgh Gutted a University Lab—Now It’s in Toronto, \nVice Motherboard (May 9, 2017), https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3dxkej/ubers-ai-hub-\nin-pittsburgh-gutted-a-university-lab-now-its-in-toronto.  \n27 Joseph Weizenbaum, Computers, Power, and Human Reason: from Calculation to Judgment 271-72 \n(1976) (discussing funding sources for AI research).  \n",

Some would characterize spam filters that leverage ML or simple \nchat bots on social media—programmed to, for instance, reply to posts about \nclimate change by denying its basis in science—as AI. Others would limit the term to \nhighly complex instantiations such as DARPA’s Cognitive Assistant that Learns and \nOrganizes (CALO)29 or the guidance software of a fully driverless car. We might also \ndraw a distinction between disembodied AI, which acquires, processes, and outputs \ninformation as data, and robotics or other cyber-physical systems, which leverage AI \nto act physically upon the world. Indeed, there is reason to believe the law will treat \nthese two categories differently.30  \n \nRegardless, many of the devices and services we access today—from iPhone \nautocorrect to Google Images—leverage trained pattern recognition systems or \ncomplex algorithms that a generous definition of AI might encompass. The \ndiscussion that follows does not assume a minimal threshold of AI complexity but \nfocuses instead on what is different about contemporary AI from previous or \nconstituent technologies such as computers and the Internet.   \n \nWhy AI “policy”?  \n \nThat artificial intelligence lacks a stable, consensus definition or instantiation \ncomplicates efforts to develop an appropriate policy infrastructure. We might \nquestion the very utility of the word “policy” in describing societal efforts to channel \nAI in the public interest. There are other terms in circulation. A new initiative \nanchored by MIT’s Media Lab and Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for \nInternet and Society, for instance, refers to itself as the “Ethics and Governance of \nArtificial Intelligence Fund.” Perhaps these are better words. Or perhaps it makes no \ndifference, in the end, what labels we use as long as the task is to explore and \nchannel AI’s social impacts and our work is nuanced and rigorous. \n \nI select the term policy deliberately for several reasons.

Ethics as a construct is notoriously malleable and \ncontested: both Kant and Bentham get to say “should.”32 Policy—in the sense of \nofficial policy, at least—has a degree of finality once promulgated.33 Moreover, even \nassuming moral consensus, ethics lacks a hard enforcement mechanism. A handful \nof companies dominate the emerging AI industry. They are going to prefer ethical \nstandards over binding rules for the obvious reason that no tangible penalties attach \nto changing or disregarding ethics should the necessity arise.  \n \nIndeed, the unfolding development of a professional ethics of AI, while at one level \nwelcome and even necessary, merits ongoing attention.34 History is replete with \nexamples of new industries forming ethical codes of conduct, only to have those \ncodes invalidated by the federal government (the Department of Justice or Federal \nTrade Commission) as a restraint on trade. The National Society of Professional \nEngineers alone has been the subject of litigation across several decades. In the \n1970s, the DOJ sued the NSPE for establishing a “canon of ethics” that prohibited \ncertain bidding practice; in the 1990s, the FTC sued the NSPE for restricting \nadvertising practices.35 The ethical codes of structural engineers have also been the \nsubject of complaints, as have the codes of numerous other industries.36 Will AI \nengineers fare differently? This is not to say companies or groups should avoid \nethical principles, only that we should pay attention to their effects. \n \nThe term governance has its attractions. Like policy, governance is a flexible term \nthat can accommodate many modalities and structures. Perhaps too flexible: it is not \nentirely clearly what is being governed and by whom.

Policy admits of the possibility \nof new laws, but does not require them. It may not be wise or even feasible to pass \ngeneral laws about artificial intelligence at this early stage.

There are several places where I draw distinctions or parallels that are not \nrepresented elsewhere in the literature, with which others may disagree. Ultimately \nthis represents but one informed scholars take on a complex and dynamic area of \nstudy.  \n \nA. Justice and Equity \n \nPerhaps the most visible and developed area of AI policy to date involves the \ncapacity of algorithms or trained systems to reflect human values such as fairness, \naccountability, and transparency (FAT).41 This topic is the subject of considerable \nstudy, including an established but accelerating literature on technological due \nprocess and at least one annual conference on the design of FAT systems.42 The \ntopic is also potentially quite broad, encompassing both the prospect of bias in AI-\nenabled features or products as well as the use of AI in making material decisions \nregarding financial, health, and even liberty outcomes. In service of teasing out \nspecific policy issues, I separate “applied inequality” from “consequential decision-\nmaking” while acknowledging the considerable overlap.   \n \nInequality in application \n \nBy inequality in application, I mean to refer to a particular set of problems involving \nthe design and deployment of AI that works well for everyone.

Must the system be safer than humans unaided or humans \nassisted by cutting-edge safety features? Must the system be safer than humans \noverall or across all driving conditions? And just how much safer must driverless \ncars be than people before we tolerate or incentivize them? These are ultimately \ndifficult questions not of technology but of policy.77 \n \nEven assuming policymakers set satisfactory safety thresholds for driverless cars, \ndrone delivery, and other instantiations of AI, we need to determine a proper and \nacceptable means of verifying that these standards are met. This process has an \ninstitutional or “who” component—e.g., government testing, third-party \nindependent certification, and self-certification by industry—as well as a technical \nor “how” component—e.g., unit testing, fault-injection, virtualization, supervision.78 \nLocal and international standards can be a starting point but considerable work has \nyet to be done—especially as new potential applications and settings arise.

Note that unlike some of the policy questions discussed \nabove, which envision the consequential deployment of imperfect AI, the privacy \nquestions that follow assume AI that is performing its assigned tasks only too well.  \n \nThe problem of pattern recognition \n \nThe capacity of AI to recognize patterns people cannot themselves detect threatens \nto eviscerate the already unstable boundary between what is public and what is \nprivate.

With enough data about you and the \npopulation at large, firms, governments, and other institutions with access to AI will \none day make guesses about you that you cannot imagine—what you like, whom \nyou love, what you have done.90 \n \nSeveral serious policy challenges follow.

In that the entire purpose of AI is to spot patterns people \ncannot, however, the issue is rapidly coming to a head. Perhaps the mainstreaming \nof AI technology will increase the pressure on policymakers to step in and protect \nconsumers. Perhaps not. Researchers are, at any rate, already exploring various \nalternatives to the status quo: fighting fire with fire by putting AI in the hands of \nconsumers, for example, or abandoning notice and choice altogether in favor of \nrules and standards. Whatever path we take should bear in mind the many ways \npowerful firms can subvert and end run consumer interventions and the \nunlikelihood consumers will keep up in a technological arms race. \n \nConsumer privacy is under siege. Citizens, meanwhile, will have next to no ability to \nresist or reform surveillance.92 Two doctrines in particular interact poorly with the \nnew affordances of artificial intelligence, both related to the reasonable expectation \nof privacy standard embedded in American constitutional law. First, the \ninterpretation of the Fourth Amendment by the courts that citizens enjoy no \nreasonable expectation of privacy in public or from a public vantage does not seem \nlong for this world.93 If everyone in public can be identified through facial \nrecognition, and if the “public” habits of individuals or groups permit AI to derive \nprivate facts, then citizens will have little choice but to convey information to a \ngovernment bent on public surveillance. Second, and related, the interpretation by \nthe courts that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in (non-\ncontent) information they convey to a third party such as the telephone company \nwill continue to come under strain.94 \n \nHere is an area where grappling with legal doctrine seems inevitable. Courts are \npolicymakers of a kind and the judiciary is already responding to these new realities \nby requiring warrants or probable cause in contexts involving public movements or \nthird party information. For example, the Supreme Court required a warrant for \nofficers to affix a GPS to a defendant’s vehicle for the purpose of continuous \nmonitoring, which five Justices worrying aloud over law enforcement’s ability to \nderive intimate information from public travel over time.95 There is a case before \n                                                        \n91 Daniel J.

The first two are avenues largely \navailable to big firms or institutions such as Facebook or the military.  \n \nThe reality that a handful of large entities (literally, fewer than a human has fingers) \npossess orders of magnitude more data than anyone else leads to a policy question \naround data parity. Smaller firms will have trouble entering and competing in the \nmarketplace. Industry research labs will come to far outstrip public labs or \nuniversities, to the extend they do not already. Accordingly, cutting-edge AI \npractitioners will face even greater incentives to enter the private sphere, and ML \napplications will bend systematically toward the goals of profit-driven companies \nand not society at large. Companies will possess not only more and better \ninformation but a monopoly on its serious analysis.  \n \nWhy do I label the question of asymmetric access to data a “privacy” question? I do \nso because privacy ultimately governs the set of responsible policy outcomes that \narise in response to the data parity problem. Firms will, and already do, invoke \nconsumer privacy as a rationale for not permitting access to their data. This is partly \nwhy the AI policy community must maintain a healthy dose of skepticism toward \n“ethical codes of conduct” developed by industry.104 Such codes are likely to contain \na principle of privacy that, unless carefully crafted, operates to help shield the \ncompany from an obligation to share training data with other stakeholders.  \n \nThere is also the related question of access to government data. Or, more precisely, \ncitizen data held by the government. Governments possess an immense amount of \ninformation; data that citizens are obligated to provide to the state forms the \nbackbone of the contemporary data broker industry.105 Firms big and small, as well \nas university and other researchers, may be able to access government data on \ncomparable terms. But there are policy challenges here as well. Governments can \nand should place limits and conditions around sharing data.106 In the United States \nat least, this means carefully crafting policies to avoid constitutional scrutiny as \ninfringements on speech.

Indeed, I present this issue as a key policy challenge precisely because \nI believe we need mechanisms by which to achieve a greater measure of data parity \nwithout sacrificing personal or collective privacy. Some within academic and \nindustry are already working on methods—including differential privacy and \nfederated training—that seek to minimize the privacy impact of granting broader \naccess to data-intensive systems.108 The hard policy question is how to incentivize \ntechnical, legal, social, and other interventions that safeguard privacy even as AI is \ndemocratized.  \n \nE. Taxation and Displacement of Labor \n \nA common concern, especially in public discourse, is that AI will displace jobs by \nmastering tasks currently performed by people.109 The classic example is the truck \ndriver: many have observed that self-driving vehicles could obviate, or at least \nradically transform, this very common role. Machines have been replacing people \nsince the Industrial Revolution (which was hard enough on society). The difference, \nmany suppose, is twofold: first, the process of automation will be much faster, and \nsecond, very few sectors will remain untouched by AI’s contemporary and \nanticipated capabilities.110 This would widen the populations that could feel AI’s \nimpact and limits the efficacy of unemployment benefits or retraining.  \n \nIn its exploration of AI’s impact on America, the Obama White House specifically \ninquired into the impact of AI on the job force and issued a report recommending a \nthicker social safety net to manage the upcoming disruption.111 Some predict that \nnew jobs will arise even as old ones fall away, or that AI will often improve the day \nto day of workers by permitting them to focus on more reword tasks involving \njudgment and creativity with which AI struggles. Others explore the eventual need \nfor a universal basic income, presumably underwritten by gains in productivity for \n                                                        \n108 Differential Privacy, Cynthia Dwork, 33rd International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and \nProgramming, part II (ICALP 2006), https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/02/dwork.pdf.  \n109 Ford, supra note 3. \n110 Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity \nin a Time of Brilliant Technologies (2014).  \n111 White House, Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy (Dec. 2016), \nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Artificial-\nIntelligence-Automation-Economy.PDF.  \n",

Taxation is a highly \ncomplex policy domain that touches upon virtual all aspects of society; AI is no \nexception. Robots do not pay taxes, as the IRS once remarked in letter.114 Bill Gates, \nJr. thinks they should.115 Others warn that a tax on automation amounts to a tax on \ninnovation and progress. Ultimately federal and state policymakers will have to \nfigure out how to keep the lights on in the absence of, for instance, the bulk of \ntoday’s income taxes.  \n \nF. Cross-Cutting Questions (Selected) \n \nThe preceding list of questions is scarcely exhaustive as to consequences of artificial \nintelligence for law and policy. Notably missing is any systemic review of the ways \nAI challenges existing legal doctrines. For example, that AI’s are capable of \ngenerating spontaneous speech or content raises doctrinal questions around the \nlimits of the First Amendment as well as the contours of intellectual property.116  \nBelow I separately discuss the prospect that AI will wake up and kill us, which, if \ntrue, would seem to render every other policy context moot. But the preceding \ninventory does cover most of the common big picture policy questions that tend to \ndominant serious discourse around artificial intelligence.  \n \nIn addition to these specific policy contexts such as privacy, labor, or the use of \nforce, recurrent issues arise that cut across domains. I have selected a few here that \ndeserve greater attention: determining the best institutional configuration for \ngoverning AI, investing collective resources in AI that benefit individuals and \nsociety, addressing hurdles to AI accountability, and addressing our tendency to \nanthropomorphize technologies such as AI.

Today AI policy is done, if at all, by \npiecemeal; federal agencies, states, cities, and other government units tackle issues \nthat most relate to them in isolation. There are advantages to this approach similar \nto the advantages of experimentation inherent in federalism—the approach is \nsensitive to differences across contexts and preserves room for experimentation. \nBut some see the piecemeal approach as problematic, calling, for instance, for a kind \nof FDA for algorithms to vet every system with a serious potential to cause harm.117  \n \nAI prefigures into a common, but I think misguided, observation about the \nrelationship between law and technology. The public sees law as too slow to catch \nup to technologic innovation. Sometimes it is true that particular laws or regulations \nbecome long outdated as technology moves beyond where it was when the law was \npassed. For example, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, passed in 1986, \ninteracts poorly with a post Internet environment in part because of ECPA’s \nassumptions about how electronic communications would work.118 But this is \nhardly inevitable, and often political. The Federal Trade Commission has continued \nin its mission of protecting markets and consumers unabated, in part because it \nenforces a standard—that of unfair and deceptive practice—that is largely neutral \nas to technology.119 In other contexts, agencies have passed new rules or interpreted \nrules differently to address new techniques and practices.  \n \nThe better-grounded observation is that government lacks the requisite expertise to \nmanage society in such a deeply technically-mediated world.120 Government bodies \nare slow to hire up and face steep competition from industry. When the state does \nnot have its own experts, it must either rely on the self-interested word of private \nfirms or their proxies, or experience a paralysis of decision and action that ill-serves \ninnovation.121 Thus, one overarching policy challenge is how best to introduce \nexpertise about AI and robotics into all branches and levels of government so they \ncan make better decisions with greater confidence.  \n \nThe solution could involve new advisory bodies, such as an official Federal Advisory \nCommittee on Artificial intelligence with an existing department or a standalone \n                                                        \n117 Andrew Tutt, An FDA for Algorithms, 89 Administrative Law Review 83 (2017).  \n118 Orin Kerr, The Next Generation Communications Privacy Act, 162 University of Pennsylvania Law \nReview, 373, 375 (2014).  \n119 Woodrow Hartzog, Unfair and Deceptive Robots, 74 Maryland Law Review 785, 810-19 (2015). \n120 Calo, supra note 79.  \n121 Id.

The technical knowledge \nand affordances of the government—from the ability to test claims in a laboratory to \na working understanding of AI in lawmakers and the judiciary—will ultimately \naffect the government’s capacity to generate wise AI policy.   \n \nInvestment and Procurement \n \nThe government possesses a wide variety of means by which to channel AI in the \npublic good. As recognized by the Obama White House, which published a separate \non the topic, one way to shape AI is by investing in it.123 Investment opportunities \ninclude not only basic AI research, which advance the state of computer science and \nhelp ensure the United States remains globally competitive, but also support of \nsocial scientific research into AI’s impacts on society. Policymakers can be strategic \nabout where funds are committed and emphasize, for example, projects with an \ninterdisciplinary research agenda and a vision for the public good. \n \nIn addition, and sometimes less well recognized, the government can influence \npolicy through what it decides to purchase.124 States are capable of exerting \nconsiderable market pressures. Thus, policymakers at all levels ought to be thinking \nabout the qualities and characteristics of the AI-enabled products government will \npurchase and the companies that create them.

If so, perhaps all other \ndiscussions constitute the policy equivalent of rearranging deck chairs on the \nTitanic. Why fix the human world if AI is going to end it?  \n \nMy own view is that AI does not present an existential threat to humanity, at least \nnot in anything like the foreseeable future.

In Superintelligence, Bostrom purports to \ndemonstrate that we are on a path toward developing AI that is both enormously \nsuperior to human intelligence and presents a significant danger of turning on its \ncreators.136 Bostrom, it should be said, does not see a malignant superintelligence as \ninevitable. But he presents the danger as acute enough to merit serious \nconsideration.  \n \nA number of prominent voices in artificial intelligence have convincingly challenged \nSuperintelligence’s thesis along several lines.137 First, they argue that there is simply \nno path toward machine intelligence that rivals our own across all contexts or \n                                                        \n133 Sharkey, N., van Wynsberghe, A., Robbins, S., & Hancock, E.

This prior claim raises an interesting paradox: if AI kills everyone in the future, then we \ncannot be living in a computer simulation created by our decedents.

Computers do what you tell them to do, as the saying \ngoes, not what you want them to do. But think for a moment about the \ncharacteristics of the system AI doomsayers envision. It is simultaneously so \nprimitive as to perceive a singular goal, such as making paperclips, arbitrarily \nassigned by a person, and yet so advanced as to be capable of outwitting and \noverpowering the sum total of humanity in pursuit of this goal. I find this \ncombination of qualities at least as unlikely as the malicious AI bent on world \ndomination. \n \nOnly time can tell us for certain who is wrong and who is right. Although it is not the \nmainstream view among AI researcher and practitioners, I have attended several \nevents where established computer scientists and other smart people reflected \nsome version of the doomsday scenario.144 If there is even a remote chance that AI \nwill wake up and kill us, i.e., if the AI apocalypse is a low probability, high loss \nproblem, then perhaps we should pay some attention to the issue. The question is: \nhow much?  \n \nThe strongest argument against focusing on Skynet or HAL in 2017 is the \nopportunity cost. AI presents numerous pressing challenges to individuals and \nsociety in the very short term. “The problem is not that artificial intelligence will get \ntoo smart and take over the world,” computer scientist Pedro Domingos writes, “the \nproblem is that it’s too stupid and already has.”145 At best, investment in the study of \nAI’s existential threat diverts millions of dollars (and billions of neurons) away from \nresearch on serious questions such as how to protect society’s most vulnerable \nmembers. At worst, government, civil society, and the public at large become \ndisaffected by the lack of meaningful progress in AI policy that comes from trying to \ngain traction on a problem that does not exist and cease to invest in AI policy at all. \nBy focusing so much energy on a quixotic existential threat, we risk, in information \nscientist Solon Barocas’ words, an AI Policy Winter. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis essay had two goals. First, it sought to provide a brief primer on artificial \nintelligence by defining AI in relation to previous and constituent technologies and \nby noting the ways the contemporary conversation around AI may be unique. One of \nthe most obvious breaks with the past is the extent and sophistication of the policy \nresponse to AI in the United States and around the world.

Cryptography rearranges power: it conﬁgures who can do\nwhat, from what. This makes cryptography an inherently political tool,\nand it confers on the ﬁeld an intrinsically moral dimension. The Snowden\nrevelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral positioning\nof cryptography. They lead one to ask if our inability to eﬀectively\naddress mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our ﬁeld. I believe that\nit does. I call for a community-wide eﬀort to develop more eﬀective means\nto resist mass surveillance. I plead for a reinvention of our disciplinary\nculture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal\nimplications of our work.\nKeywords:\ncryptography · ethics · mass surveillance · privacy ·\nSnowden · social responsibility\nPreamble. Most academic cryptographers seem to think that our ﬁeld is a fun,\ndeep, and politically neutral game—a set of puzzles involving communicating\nparties and notional adversaries. This vision of who we are animates a ﬁeld\nwhose work is intellectually impressive and rapidly produced, but also quite\ninbred and divorced from real-world concerns. Is this what cryptography should\nbe like? Is it how we should expend the bulk of our intellectual capital?\nFor me, these questions came to a head with the Snowden disclosures of 2013.\nIf cryptography’s most basic aim is to enable secure communications, how could\nit not be a colossal failure of our ﬁeld when ordinary people lack even a modicum\nof communication privacy when interacting electronically? Yet I soon realized\nthat most cryptographers didn’t see it this way. Most seemed to feel that the\ndisclosures didn’t even implicate us cryptographers.\nI think that they do. So I want to talk about the moral obligations of cryp-\ntographers, and my community as a whole. This is not a topic cryptographers\nroutinely discuss. In this post-Snowden era, I think it needs to be.\n⋆This is an essay written to accompany an invited talk (the 2015 IACR Distinguished\nLecture) given at Asiacrypt 2015 on December 2, 2015, in Auckland, New Zealand.\nThe essay and talk are addressed to the cryptographic community—my community—\nand the words “we” and “our” should be so interpreted.

    "chunk_full": "2\nP. Rogaway\nPart 1: Social responsibility of scientists and engineers\nA famous manifesto. I’d like to begin with a story—a true story.1 To set the\nstage, it is London, the summer of 1955. A roomful of reporters have assembled\nfor a press conference in Caxton Hall, a red brick building in Westminister. The\nmedia have been summoned in a plan hatched by Bertrand Russell, with some\nhelp from the editor of The Observer newspaper. The reporters don’t know just\nwhy they are here, having only been told that a team of the world’s leading\nscientists were ready to release something of world-wide signiﬁcance. The press\nknows that Sir Bertrand Russell is involved. With Einstein’s recent death, Russell\nhas become the world’s most famous living intellectual.\nRussell has been in his home, hiding, all week. All day long the phone\nrings, the doorbell rings. Reporters are trying to ﬁnd out what is this big\nannouncement. Russell’s wife and his housekeeper make excuses and shoo the\nreporters away.\nAs the press conference begins, the reporters learn from Russell and\naccompanying physicist Joseph Rotblat that they have not been assembled\nto hear of some new scientiﬁc discovery, but to receive a prepared, political\nstatement. It’s a fairly brief statement, but it’s been signed by eleven2 of the\nworld’s leading scientists—nine of them Nobel laureates. Albert Einstein is\namong the signatories, signing just days before he became ill and died.\nThe document would become known as the Russell–Einstein manifesto.3 I\nhope that its contents are known to you. It speaks of the existential threat\nto mankind posed by nuclear weapons. It’s ﬁnal passage sounds desperately\nplaintive as Russell writes:\nWe appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and\nforget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you\ncannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.4\nThe reporters ask questions and soon warm to the manifesto’s importance. The\nnext day, the manifesto is carried as front-page news of most the world’s major\nnewspapers. For the next several days, at least, it is the talk of the world.\nThe Russell–Einstein manifesto galvanized the peace and disarmament\nmovements. It led to the Pugwash conferences, for which Joseph Rotblat and\nthe conferences-series itself would eventually win the Nobel Peace Prize (1995).\nRotblat credits the manifesto for helping to create the conditions that gave rise\nto the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1970).5 In his Nobel Peace Prize\nacceptance speech, Rotblat explains:\n1 This account is largely taken from Sandra Butcher: The origins of the Russell–\nEinstein manifesto. Pugwash Conference on Science and World Aﬀairs, May 2005.\n2 At the time of the press conference, Russell had heard from only eight.\n3 The name would seem to be an instance of the “Matthew eﬀect,” as signatories Max\nBorn, Fr´ed´eric Joliot-Curie, and Joseph Rotblat all played roles at least as large as\nEinstein’s.\n4 Quoted in Joseph Rotblat, ed., Proceedings of the First Pugwash Conference on\nScience and World Aﬀairs, Pugwash Council, 1982.\n5 Butcher, op. cit., Foreword, p. 3.\n",

    "chunk_full": "The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work\n3\nFrom my earliest days I had a passion for science. But science, the exercise of\nthe supreme power of the human intellect, was always linked in my mind with\nbeneﬁt to people. I saw science as being in harmony with humanity. I did not\nimagine that the second half of my life would be spent on eﬀorts to avert a\nmortal danger to humanity created by science.6\nTwo modes of behaving politically. I begin with the Russell–Einstein\nmanifesto to remind you of two things: ﬁrst, that technical work itself can\nimplicate politics; and second, that some scientists, in response, do take on\novertly political roles. These two ways to behave politically are diﬀerent (even\nif, to people like Rotblat, they go hand-in-hand). Let’s look at each.\nImplicit politics. A scientist engages in what I’ll call implicit politics by\ninﬂuencing power relations as a byproduct of technical work. Politics is about\npower—who has how much of it, and what sort. The nuclear bomb is the ultimate\nexpression of coercive power; it is politics incarnate. Had Rotblat shunned every\nostensibly political role in his life, his life’s work would still have been political.\nImmensely, if implicitly, so.\nBut we don’t need the specter of mushroom clouds to be dealing with\npolitically relevant technology: scientiﬁc and technical work routinely implicates\npolitics. This is an overarching insight from decades of work at the crossroads of\nscience, technology, and society.7 Technological ideas and technological things\nare not politically neutral: routinely, they have strong, built-in tendencies.\nTechnological advances are usefully considered not only from the lens of how\nthey work, but also why they came to be as they did, whom they help, and whom\nthey harm. Emphasizing the breadth of man’s agency and technological options,\nand borrowing a beautiful phrase of Borges, it has been said that innovation is\na garden of forking paths.8\nStill, cryptographic ideas can be quite mathematical; mightn’t this make them\nrelatively apolitical? Absolutely not. That cryptographic work is deeply tied to\npolitics is a claim so obvious that only a cryptographer could fail to see it. Thus\nI’ll devote considerable time to this claim. But let me ﬁrst speak of the second\nway for the scientist to behave politically.\nOvert politics. A scientist can engage in overt politics through the mechanisms\nof activism and participatory democracy. In writing the Russell–Einstein\n6 Joseph Rotblat, “Remember Your Humanity.” Acceptance and Nobel lecture, 1995.\nText available at Nobelprize.org\n7 The literature in this direction is too vast to possibly survey. University programs in\nthis space often go by the acronym STS, for science and technology studies or science,\ntechnology, and society. The work of Langdon Winner is particularly concerned with\nthe relation between technological artifacts and their implicit political dimension.\n8 The quote is from: Robin Williams and David Edge: The social shaping of technology.\nResearch Policy (25), 865–899, Elsevier Science B.V., (1966). The implicit reference\nis to the eerie Borges short story “El jard´ın de senderos que se bifurcan” (The Garden\nof Forking Paths) (1941).\n",

Russell was not only a mathematician: he had broad contributions\nacross philosophy, had won the Nobel prize in literature, and was a well-known\nsocial critic and anti-war activist.\nThe ethic of responsibility. Bertrand Russell’s breadth was extraordinary.\nBut the mere existence of the politically engaged intellectual doesn’t suggest that\nthis pairing is at all representative. To what extent are scientists and engineers\nsocially engaged? And to what extent do societal norms demand that they be?9\nNowadays, an ethic of responsibility is preached in university courses and\nadvocated by professional organizations. It is the doctrinal view. The putative\nnorm contends that scientists and engineers have an obligation to select work\nthat promotes the social good (a positive right), or, at the very least, to refrain\nfrom work that damages mankind or the environment (a negative right).10 The\nobligation stems from three basic truths: that the work of scientists and engineers\ntransforms society; that this transformation can be for the better or for the worse;\nand that what we do is arcane enough that we bring an essential perspective to\npublic discourse. The socially engaged scientist is expected to bring a normative\nvision for how work in his or her ﬁeld should impact society. He or she aims to\nsteer things in that direction.\nTo be sure, decision making under the ethic of responsibility is not easy. It\ncan be impossible to foresee if a line of work is going to be used for good or for ill.\nAdditionally, the for-good-or-for-ill dichotomy can be simplistic and subjective to\nthe point of meaninglessness. Still, despite such diﬃculties, the socially engaged\nscientist is supposed to investigate, think, and decide what work he will or will\nnot do, and what organizations he will or will not work for. The judgment should\nbe made without over-valuing ones own self-interest.\nHistorical events shaping the ethic of responsibility. The ascendancy of\nthe ethic of responsibility was shaped by three historical events of World War 2\nand its aftermath.\n1. The ﬁrst, already touched on, was the experience of the atomic scientists.\nAfter the war, with science left in a position both revered and feared, prominent\nphysicists became public ﬁgures. Some became outspoken in their advocacy for\npeace, or their opposition to further weapons development. Recall the widespread\nconcerns from physicists to Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)11 or\nHans Bethe’s famous letter to Bill Clinton where he argued against another\n9 Some of my comments in the remainder of this section were informed by Matthew\nWisnioski: Engineers for Change: Competing Visions of Technology in 1960s\nAmerica. MIT Press, 2012.\n10 While these two possibilities are very diﬀerent, distinguishing between them will not\nbe important for the discussion of this essay.\n11 The debate within the scientiﬁc community got signiﬁcant media attention following\nrelease of a book-length study from the American Physical Society (APS) Study\nGroup (N. Bloembergen, C. K. Patel, cochairmen), Report to The American Physical\nSociety of the Study Group on Science and Technology of Directed Energy Weapons,\n",

Videos of the event went\nviral,16 while memes of Oﬃcer Pike casually pepper-spraying anything became\na second Internet sensation. But the observation I’d like to make is that, in the\naftermath of the incident, the only UCD department outside the humanities to\ncondemn the Chancellor or call for her resignation was Physics.17 The Chancellor\nwas mystiﬁed. She understood the strong reaction from our (underfunded and\npolitically liberal) English department, but she didn’t anticipate complaints\nfrom a (well-funded and generally conservative) Physics department.18 What\nthe Chancellor might not have internalized is that physicists retain a post-war\nlegacy not only of snuggling up close to power, but also of nipping at its ankles.\n2. A second historical event that helped shape the post-war view of\nmoral responsibility was the Nuremberg trials (1945–1946). While the defense\nrepeatedly proﬀered that the accused were simply following orders, this view\nwas almost universally rejected: following orders did not eﬀace legal or moral\nculpability. The Nuremberg trials began with the Medical Case, the prosecution\nof 23 scientists, physicians, and other senior oﬃcials for gruesome and routinely\nfatal medical experiments on prisoners.19\nAPS, New York (April 1987). The debate was not one-sided: many physicists\nsupported SDI, and many felt the APS study to be too negative or too political.\n12 See http://fas.org/bethecr.htm#letter for Bethe’s 1995 letter.\n13 The well-known expression comes from a pamphlet “Speak truth to power: a Quaker\nsearch for an alternative to violence,” 1955. http://www.quaker.org/sttp.html\n14 Of course not every prominent physicist was oppositional. Edward Teller famously\nchampioned the development of fusion bombs and SDI. These positions were divisive,\nwith some of Teller’s peers seeing him as irresponsible, jingoistic, or insane.\n15 The deﬁnitive report on the incident is: Reynoso, C., Blando, P., Bush, T., Herbert,\nP., McKenna, W., Rauchway, E., Balcklock, P., Brownstein, A., Dooley, D., Kolesar,\nK., Penny, C., Sterline, R., Sakaki, J.: UC Davis Nov. 18, 2011 “Pepper Spray\nIncident” Task Force Report: The Reynoso Task Force Report.

Hannah Arendt’s controversial portrayal\nof Eichmann would come to be formative in shaping our understanding of\nwhat, ethically, had transpired during the Holocaust. She wrote of the utter\nordinariness of the man.20 Arendt’s book on the trial, memorably subtitled The\nBanality of Evil, would be published the same year (1963) as Stanley Milgram’s\nclassical experiments on obedience, where Milgram produced the stunning (and\nwidely repeated) ﬁnding that a large fraction of volunteers would follow a white-\ncoated scientist’s gentle urging to deliver apparently life-threatening shocks to\nsomeone they thought was a fellow test subject.21\n3. Finally, I would mention the rise of the environmental movement as\ncontributing to the rise of an ethic of responsibility. While environmentalism\ndates to the mid-nineteenth century and before, as a signiﬁcant social movement,\nthe 1962 publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is a milestone. Her book\npainted a picture of the end of life not by the drama of nuclear warfare, but\nthe disappearance of songbirds, silenced by the routine if oversized activities of\nchemical manufacturing and non-speciﬁc pesticides.\nThe good scientist. The three experiences I have just described implied a\ndemocratization of responsibility. Scientists had to assume responsibility for what\nthey did, for technology would take us to a very dark place if they did not.\nStripped of ethical restraint, science would bring a world of nightmare bombs,\ngas chambers, and macabre human experiments. It would bring a dying, poisoned\nworld.\nAnd so, in the decades following the war, the ethic of responsibility became—\nat least rhetorically—the doctrinal norm. Increasing numbers of scientists and\nengineers, as well as their professional organizations, began to engage on\nissues of social responsibility. The Pugwash Conferences began in 1955. The\nNational Society of Professional Engineers adopted a code of ethics in 1964\nthat gave primacy to social responsibility. As its ﬁrst imperative, the code\nsays that “Engineers, in the fulﬁllment of their professional duties, shall hold\nparamount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” Similar language\nwould spread across other codes of ethics, including those of the ACM and\nIEEE.22 The Union of Concerned Scientists was formed at MIT in 1969—the\nsame year a work stoppage at MIT, coordinated with 30 other universities,\nenjoyed substantial student, faculty, and administrative support. It called for\na realignment of research directions away from military pursuits and towards\nhuman needs.

At this point, it is central to mankind’s mission.\nWhile technology does bring some unintended consequences, innovation itself\nwill see us through.\nTechnological optimism animates everyone from school children to Turing\nAward winners. Accepting his 2012 Turing Award, Silvio Micali, said that\nComputer science is marking an epical change in human history. We are\nconquering a new and vast scientiﬁc continent. . . .

They saw modern technology as an interlocking, out-of-control\nsystem that, instead of fulﬁlling human needs, engendered pointless wants and\ndeadlier weapons.

Contextualism dominates the dialectic of technology\nstudies.\nThe ethic of responsibility is always paired with the contextualist view of\nsociotechnology. At some level, this must be so: a normative need vanishes if, in\nthe garden of forking paths, all paths lead to good (or, for that matter, to bad).\nBut it is technological optimism that most people buy into, especially scientists\nand engineers. And unbridled technological optimism undermines the basic need\nfor social responsibility.\nConclusion to part 1. Ultimately, I think the post-war turn towards social\nresponsibility in science and engineering was less a turn than a sideways glance.\nWhile the rhetoric of responsibility would provide cover from technology’s critics,\nfew scientists or engineers would ever come to internalize that their work\nembodied socially relevant values. If researchers like us were actually supposed\nto know or care about this stuﬀin any operationally signiﬁcant way, well, I think\nwe didn’t get the memo.\nSo let me retransmit it. It says that your moral duties extend beyond the\nimperative that you personally do no harm: you have to try to promote the social\ngood, too. Also, it says that your moral duties stem not just from your stature\nas a moral individual, but, also, from the professional communities to which you\nbelong: cryptographer, computer scientist, scientist, technologist.\nWith few exceptions, the atomic scientists who worked on disarmament\nwere not the same individuals as those who built the bomb. Their colleagues—\nfellow physicists—did that. Cryptographers didn’t turn the Internet into an\ninstrument of total surveillance, but our colleagues—fellow computer scientists\nand engineers—did that. And cryptographers have some capacity to help.\nBut you will only believe that claim if you recognize that cryptography can\ninﬂuence power relations. I suspect that many of you see no real connection\nbetween social, political, and ethical values and what you work on. You don’t\nbuild bombs, experiment on people, or destroy the environment. You don’t spy\non populations. You hack math and write papers. This doesn’t sound ethically\nladen. I want to show you that it is.\nPart 2: The political character of cryptographic work\nScientist or spy? There’s an irony in discussing the claim that cryptographic\nwork is political, and it is this: to someone unconnected to the ﬁeld, and also\nto the crypto-hobbyist, the claim may seem obviously true. But the young\nresearcher who spends his life writing papers in cryptography, the claim may\nseem just as obviously false. What gives?\nThe outsider’s view of cryptography might be based on cinematic portrayals.\nFilms like Sneakers (1992), Pi (1998), A Beautiful Mind (2001), Enigma (2001),\nTraveling Salesman (2012), Citizenfour (2014), and The Imitation Game (2014)\ndepict cryptography as a ﬁeld intertwined with politics.

We work on problems that strike us as\ninteresting or scientiﬁcally important. We’re not aiming to advance the interests\nof anything but science itself (or, perhaps, one’s own career).\nSo distinct claims about cryptography’s connectedness to power stem, at least\nin part, from radically diﬀerent archetypes of what the cryptographer is: scientist\nor spy.

This paper would\nbe just as seminal—but in spawning work mostly outside the core cryptographic\ncommunity. The ten most cited papers that cite Chaum’s paper appear in venues\nthat, mostly, I had never heard of. Venues not crypto-focused, like MobiSys and\nSIGOPS. In fact, the venues for the ten most cited papers citing [GM82] and the\nvenues for the ten most cited papers citing [Chaum81] have void intersection. I\nﬁnd this fairly remarkable. It reﬂects a research community split into fragments\nthat include a GM-derived one and a Chaum-derived one, the second fragment\nnot really being a part of the cryptographic community at all.62\nWhy did this fragmentation occur? The most obvious explanation has\nto do with rigor: [GM82] oﬀered a mathematically precise approach to its\nsubject, while [Chaum81] did not. So a partitioning might seem to make sense:\ncryptographic work that can be mathematically formal goes to the right; ad hoc\nstuﬀ, over to the left.\nThe problem with this explanation is that it’s wrong. The [Chaum81] paper\nsupports rigor just ﬁne.

That’s true. But\nit’s simpler to formalize than MPC,65 say, which would quickly gain entr´ee and\nstature in the cryptographic community—even without deﬁnitions or proofs.

Where, after Chaum, did the moral soul of academic cryptography\ngo? Maybe it moved to PETS.\nThere is a lesson in all this.

Now there is a group that has long worked at the nexus\nof cryptography and politics: the cypherpunks.67 The cypherpunks emerged in\nthe late 1980’s, uniﬁed by a mailing list and some overlapping values. The core\nbelief is that cryptography can be a key tool for protecting individual autonomy\nthreatened by power.68\nThe cypherpunks believed that a key question of our age was whether state\nand corporate interests would eviscerate liberty through electronic surveillance\nand its consequences, or if, instead, people would protect themselves through the\nartful use of cryptography. The cypherpunks did not seek a world of universal\nprivacy: many wanted privacy for the individual, and transparency for the\ngovernment and corporate elites. The cypherpunks envisioned that one could\nhack power relations by writing the right code. Cypherpunk-styled creations—\nthink of Bitcoin, PGP, Tor, and WikiLeaks—were to be transformative because\nthey challenge authority and address basic freedoms: freedom of speech,\nmovement, and economic engagement.69\nExactly how such tools are to shape society is not always obvious. Consider\nWikiLeaks. The hope is not just that a better informed public will demand\naccountability and change. Rather, Assange sees governmental and corporate\nabuse as forms of conspiracy that could be throttled by the mere threat of leaks.\nConspiracies are like graphs, the conspirators nodes, the pairwise relations among\nthem, the edges. Instead of removing nodes or disrupting links, you can weaken\nany conspiracy by suﬀusing it in an ever-present threat of leaks. The more unjust\nthe conspiracy, the more likely leaks will occur, and the more damage they will\ndo. As elites become fearful to conspire, they do so reservedly. The conspiratorial\ncreature’s blood thickens and it dies.70 It is a fascinating vision.\nIt is cypherpunks, not cryptographers, who are normally the strongest\nadvocates for cryptography.

March 2011.\n68 It is the same belief embedded in the work already discussed by David Chaum.\n69 I have heard academic cryptographers saying that we deserve credit for these\nartifacts, for, regardless of who wrote the code, the ideas stem from cryptographic\nnotions that come from us. While there is some truth to this, the claim still feels\nungenuine. The work, in each case, arose from somewhere else, employed only old\nand basic tools, and was at most modestly embraced by our community.\n70 Julian\nAssange:\nConspiracy\nas\ngovernance.\nManuscript,\nDecember\n3,\n2006.\nhttp://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf.

A strange\nproperty of the physical universe that we live in.\nThe universe believes in encryption.\nIt is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.\nWe saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new\nworld.71\nSimilarly, Edward Snowden writes:72\nIn words from history, let us speak no more of faith in man, but bind him\ndown from mischief by the chains of cryptography.73\nWhen I ﬁrst encountered such discourse, I smugly thought the authors were\nway over-promising: they needed to tone down this rhetoric to be accurate. I\nno longer think this way. More engaged in implementing systems than I’ll ever\nbe, top cypherpunks understand more than I about insecure operating systems,\nmalware, programming bugs, subversion, side channels, poor usability, small\nanonymity sets, and so on. Cypherpunks believe that despite such obstacles,\ncryptography can still be transformative.\nCryptography favors whom? Cypherpunk discourse seems sometimes to\nassume that cryptography will beneﬁt ordinary people. But one has to be careful\nhere. Cryptography can be developed in directions that tend to beneﬁt the weak\nor the powerful. It can also be pursued in ways likely to beneﬁt nobody but the\ncryptographer. Let’s look at some examples.\nEncryption. One reason people might assume cryptography to beneﬁt the weak\nis that they’re thinking of cryptography as conventional encryption. Individuals\nwith minimal resources can encrypt plaintexts in a manner that even a state-level\nadversary, lacking the key, won’t be able to decrypt.\nBut does it necessarily come out that way? To work, cryptographic primitives\nmust be embedded into systems, and those systems can realize arrangements of\npower that don’t trivially ﬂow from the nature of the tool. In his typically pithy\nway, Schneier reminds people that “encryption is just a bunch of math, and math\nhas no agency.”74 If a content-provider streams an encrypted ﬁlm to a customer\nwho holds the decryption key locked within a hardware or software boundary\nshe has no realistic ability to penetrate,75 we’ve empowered content providers,\n71 Julian Assange: Cypherpunks, op. cit.\n72 I do not know if Snowden considers himself a cypherpunk, but the sentiment\nexpressed in this quote nicely reﬂects cypherpunk discourse.\n73 Edward Snowden, quoted in Glenn Greenwald, No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden,\nthe NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State, 2014.

If we couple public-key cryptography with a key-escrow system that\nthe FBI and NSA can exploit, we empower governments, not people.76\nAll that said, I do believe it accurate to say that conventional encryption does\nembed a tendency to empower ordinary people. Encryption directly supports\nfreedom of speech. It doesn’t require expensive or diﬃcult-to-obtain resources.\nIt’s enabled by a thing that’s easily shared. An individual can refrain from\nusing backdoored systems.77 Even the customary language for talking about\nencryption suggests a worldview in which ordinary people—the world’s Alices\nand Bobs—are to be aﬀorded the opportunity of private discourse. And coming\nat it from the other direction, one has to work to embed encryption within an\narchitecture that props up power, and one may encounter major obstacles to\nsuccess. The Clipper Chip completely failed. Trusted Computing mostly did.78\nIBE.79 What about identity-based encryption, IBE? The setting was proposed\nby Shamir, with Boneh and Franklin, years later, providing a satisfying, provably\nsecure realization.80 The aim is to allow a party’s email address, for example, to\nserve as his public key. So if Alice already knows the email address for Bob, she\nwon’t need to obtain his public key to send him an encrypted message: she just\nencrypts under Bob’s email address.\nBut this convenience is enabled by a radical change in the trust model: Bob’s\nsecret key is no longer self-selected. It is issued by a trusted authority. That\nauthority knows everyone’s secret key in the system. IBE embeds key escrow—\nindeed a form of key escrow where a single entity implicitly holds all secret\nkeys—even ones that haven’t yet been issued. And even if you do trust the key-\ngenerating authority, a state-level adversary now has an extremely attractive\nlocus to subpoena or subvert. In the end, from a personal-privacy point of view,\nIBE might seem like an enormous leap backwards.\nboundary.

Rogaway\nDescriptions of IBE don’t usually emphasize the change in trust model.81\nAnd the key-issuing authority seems never to be named anything like that: it’s\njust the PKG, for Private Key Generator. This sounds more innocuous than\nit is, and more like an algorithm than an entity. In papers, the PKG further\nrecedes from view because it is the tuple of algorithms, not the entities that one\nimagines to run them, that grounds formal deﬁnitions and proofs.\nTo be clear, I am not condemning IBE as some sort of fascist technology. That\nsounds silly. Nor am I suggesting that IBE can’t be reﬁned in ways to make\nthe trust model less authoritarian.82 Yet one can easily see the authoritarian\ntendency built into IBE. And technologies, while adaptable, are not inﬁnitely\nso. As they evolve, they tend to retain their implicit orientations.\nDiﬀerential privacy. Let’s consider diﬀerential privacy.83 Dwork says that\nϵ-diﬀerential privacy “addresses concerns that any participant might have about\nthe leakage of her personal information: even if the participant removed her\ndata from the data set, no outputs . . . would become signiﬁcantly more or less\nlikely.”84\nAt some level, this sounds great: don’t we want to protect individuals from\nprivacy-compromising disclosures from corporate or governmental datasets? But\na more critical and less institutionally friendly perspective makes this deﬁnitional\nline seem oﬀ.85 Most basically, the model implicitly paints the database owner\n(the curator) as the good guy, and the users querying it, the adversary. If power\nwould just agree to fudge with the answers in the right way, it would be ﬁne for\nit to hold massive amounts of personal data about each of us. But the history\nof data-privacy breaches suggests that the principal threat to us is from the\ndatabase owner itself, and those that gain wholesale access to the data (for\nexample, by theft or secret government programs). Second, the harm diﬀerential-\nprivacy seeks to avoid is conceived of in entirely individualistic terms. But privacy\nviolations harm entire communities. The individualistic focus presupposes a\nnarrow conception of privacy’s value. Finally,86 diﬀerential privacy implicitly\npresupposes that the data collection serves some public good. But, routinely,\nthis is a highly contestable claim. The alternative of less data collection, or no\n81 For example, the Wikipedia entry “ID-based encryption” (Nov. 2015) has a lead\nsection that fails to even mention the presence of a key-issuing authority.\n82 For many IBE schemes it is easy to distribute the PKG’s secret, the master key,\nacross a set of parties. One could further arrange for distributed generation of this\nkey, so no one party ever held it. Both of these points are made in the original Boneh\nand Franklin paper: op. cit., Section 6, Distributed PKG.\n83 See, for example: Cynthia Dwork: Diﬀerential privacy: a survey of results.

In the end, one must compare\nthe reduction in harm actually aﬀorded by using diﬀerential privacy with the\nincrease in harm aﬀorded by corporations having another means of whitewash,\nand policy-makers believing, quite wrongly, that there is some sort of crypto-\nmagic to protect people from data misuse.\nI recently asked an expert in diﬀerential privacy, Ilya Mironov, for his reaction\nto my harsh critique. He explained that the abstract roles in diﬀerential-privacy\nsettings need not correspond to business relationships in the obvious way. For\nexample, a privacy-conscious organization might choose to make its own analysts\naccess sensitive data through an API that provides some diﬀerential-privacy\nguarantee, eﬀectively treating its own employees as “adversaries.” Mironov\nalso explained that there are variant notions of diﬀerential privacy that do\nnot implicitly regard the database owner as good, and those querying it as\nbad. He described diﬀerential privacy in the local model,87 where everyone\nkeeps his data to himself. They can distributively compute the responses to\nqueries. Fundamentally, Mironov explained, the deﬁnition of diﬀerential privacy\nis agnostic to the data model.\nWhile everything explained makes good sense, I don’t think it changes the\nlandscape. No actual mechanism can be agnostic to what data resides where.\nAnd at the point when a data-mining architecture and mechanism is laid\ndown, considerations of eﬃciency, familiarity, and economics—not to mention\nauthorities’ fundamental desire to have and to hold the data—make it easy to\npredict what will happen: almost always, a centralized design will emerge. To\nme, diﬀerential privacy may be as authoritarian in its conceptual underpinnings\nas IBE.\nFHE and iO. Ever since Craig Gentry’s groundbreaking work,88 fully homo-\nmorphic encryption (FHE) has been a target of enormous intellectual capital.\nIn brief, FHE allows you to outsource your data, encrypted under a public key\nof your choosing, to a service provider. Later, you can ask that party whatever\nyou’d like about your plaintext. The service provider computes the encrypted\nanswer, not knowing what it means. This is returned to you for decryption.\nFrom a political perspective, FHE sounds empowering—even utopian. The\npowerful party, say a cloud service provider, is denied access to your data.

If you want to assess the political\nleanings of something of speculative utility, you shouldn’t just assume that it\nwill give rise to the touted applications, and then try to see who would win and\nwho would lose. It’s too conjectural. It is better to focus on how the pursuit\nchanges us in the here and now.\nAnd on that, I would say that FHE, along with iO,90 have engendered a new\nwave of exuberance. In grant proposals, media interviews, and talks, leading\ntheorists speak of FHE and iO as game-changing indications of where we have\ncome.91 Nobody seems to emphasize just how speculative it is that any of this\nwill ever have any impact on practice.

We’re also told: that we\nneed to collect everything because, if we didn’t, we wouldn’t have enough data\nto have lots of data; that the government will be careful, as it would be “creepy”\nif they weren’t; that they’ll get court orders—even, apparently, to discover the\nnumber of people in datasets who satisfy some speciﬁed search criteria; and that\nto get personally identiﬁable information, they’ll need to have the cooperation\nof the NSA and the FISA court.\nKaufman’s inchoate interview is but a tiny patch of discourse from an ocean\nof misdirection on privacy. It doesn’t impugn FHE, but it does suggest how power\naims to use such work: to let them mumble words that sound privacy-friendly.\nProviding strong funding for FHE and iO provides risk-free political cover. It\nsupports a storyline that cloud storage and computing is safe. It helps entrench\nfavored values within the cryptographic community: speculative, theory-centric\ndirections. And it helps keep harmless academics who could, if they got feisty,\nstart to innovate in more sensitive directions.\nCryptanalysis. Finally, let me brieﬂy mention cryptanalysis. One might\nmisinterpret the academic cryptanalytic undertaking as an attack on the privacy\nof legitimate users—an attack on the inoﬀensive Alice and Bob—which would\nthus seem to favor power.93 But this is the opposite of the right view. The reason\nthat academic cryptographers do cryptanalysis is to better inform the designers\nand users of cryptosystems about what is and what is not safe to do. The activity\nis not done to surveil people, but to help ensure that people are not surveilled—\nat least by cryptanalytic means. And the work routinely has exactly that eﬀect.\nThe history of WEP provides a nice example.94\nWhen the NSA or GCHQ engage in cryptanalysis, it is for a very diﬀerent\npurpose, and it has a very diﬀerent eﬀect. Does that mean that cryptanalysis\ndone by one group of people (spooks) will tend to favor authority, while\ncryptanalysis done by another group of people (academics) will tend in the exact\nopposite direction? It does. The speciﬁc work will be diﬀerent; its dissemination\nwill be diﬀerent; and its impact on human rights will be diﬀerent.\nUnthreateningly engaged.

A 2013 essay by Arvind Narayanan suggests a simple\ntaxonomy for cryptographic work:100 there’s crypto-for-security and crypto-for-\nprivacy. Crypto-for-security is crypto for commercial purposes. It’s the crypto in\nTLS, payment cards, and cell phones. Crypto-for-privacy has social or political\naims. Here the author distinguishes between pragmatic crypto—which is about\ntrying to use cryptography to retain our predigital privacy—and cypherpunk\ncrypto—the grander hope of using cryptography to precipitate sweeping social\nor political reforms. The author suggests that crypto-for-security has done well,\nbut crypto-for-privacy has fared badly.\nI think Narayanan’s division is illuminating, but he fails to mention that most\nacademic cryptography isn’t really crypto-for-security or crypto-for-privacy: it\nis, one could say, crypto-for-crypto—meaning that it doesn’t ostensibly beneﬁt\ncommerce or privacy, and it’s quite speculative if it will ever evolve to do either.\nPerhaps every ﬁeld eventually becomes primarily self-referential. Maybe this is\neven necessary, to some extent. But for cryptography, much is lost when we\nbecome so inward-looking that almost nobody is working on problems we could\nhelp with that address some basic human need.

Before the Snowden revelations,101 I myself didn’t really think so.\nEnvironmental problems seemed more threatening to man’s future, and my\ncountry’s endless wars seemed more deserving of moral consternation. It wasn’t\nuntil Snowden that I ﬁnally internalized that the surveillance issue was grave, was\nclosely tied to our values and our profession, and was being quite misleadingly\nframed.\nLaw-enforcement framing. The framing of mass surveillance determines what\none thinks it is about.102 And mass surveillance has been brilliantly framed by\nauthority so as to slant discourse in a particular and predictable direction. Let me\ndescribe what I’ll call the law-enforcement framing, as regularly communicated\nby (U.S.) FBI Director James Comey:103\n1. Privacy is personal good. It’s about your desire to control personal informa-\ntion about you.\n2. Security, on the other hand, is a collective good. It’s about living in a safe\nand secure world.\n3. Privacy and security are inherently in conﬂict. As you strengthen one, you\nweaken the other. We need to ﬁnd the right balance.\n4. Modern communications technology has destroyed the former balance. It’s\nbeen a boon to privacy, and a blow to security. Encryption is especially\nthreatening. Our laws just haven’t kept up.104\n5. Because of this, bad guys may win. The bad guys are terrorists, murderers,\nchild pornographers, drug traﬃckers, and money launderers.105 The technol-\nogy that we good guys use—the bad guys use it too, to escape detection.\n101 For a review of key information learned from the Snowden revelations, see the\nEFF webpages “NSA Spying on America,” https://www.eﬀ.org/nsa-spying, and\nthe ACLU webpage, “NSA Surveillance,” https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-\nsecurity/privacy-and-surveillance/nsa-surveillance\n102 Collin Bennett: The Privacy Advocates: Resisting the Spread of Surveillance.

Note that\nin Comey’s Brookings Institute speech, the speaker adds murderers to this list, and\nsubtracts money launderers. The move is shrewed; money laundering is technocratic\nand legalistic crime compared to murder.\n",

Power need not be in-your-face to be eﬀective: subtle, psychological,\nnearly invisible methods can actually be more eﬀective.\n2. While surveillance is nothing new, technological changes have given govern-\nments and corporations an unprecedented capacity to monitor everyone’s\ncommunication and movement. Surveilling everyone has became cheaper\nthan ﬁguring out whom to surveil, and the marginal cost is now tiny.111 The\nInternet, once seen by many as a tool for emancipation, is being transformed\ninto the most dangerous facilitator for totalitarianism ever seen.112\n3.

Michael Hayden has explained, “we\nkill people based on metadata.”113 Surveillance and assassination by drones\nare one technological ecosystem.\n4. The law-enforcement narrative is wrong to position privacy as an individual\ngood when it is, just as much, a social good. It is equally wrong to regard\nprivacy and security as conﬂicting values, as privacy enhances security as\noften as it rubs against it.\n5. Mass surveillance will tend to produce uniform, compliant, and shallow\npeople.114 It will thwart or reverse social progress. In a world of ubiquitous\nmonitoring, there is no space for personal exploration, and no space to\nchallenge social norms, either. Living in fear, there is no genuine freedom.\n6. But creeping surveillance is hard to stop, because of interlocking corporate\nand governmental interests.115 Cryptography oﬀers at least some hope. With\nit, one might carve out a space free of power’s reach.\nHistory teaches that extensive governmental surveillance becomes political\nin character. As civil-rights attorney Frank Donner and the Church Commission\nreports thoroughly document, domestic surveillance under U.S. FBI director\nJ. Edgar Hoover served as a mechanism to protect the status quo and\nneutralize change movements.116 Very little of the FBI’s surveillance-related\neﬀorts were directed at law-enforcement: as the activities surveilled were rarely\nillegal, unwelcome behavior would result in sabotage, threats, blackmail, and\ninappropriate prosecutions, instead. For example, leveraging audio surveillance\ntapes, the FBI’s attempted to get Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to kill himself.117\nU.S. universities were thoroughly inﬁltrated with informants: selected students,\nfaculty, staﬀ, and administrators would report to an extensive network of\nFBI handlers on anything political going on on campus. The surveillance\nof dissent became an institutional pillar for maintaining political order. The\nU.S. COINTELPRO program would run for more than 15 years, permanently\nreshaping the U.S. political landscape.118\n113 Michael Hayden: The Johns Hopkins Foreign Aﬀairs Symposium Presents: The\nPrice of Privacy: Re-Evaluating the NSA.

Where mass surveillance leads has been brilliantly\nexplored in ﬁctional accounts, starting with Yevgeny Zamyatin’s 1921 novel We\n(which inspired Orwell’s 1984). Set in a future of total surveillance, the denizens\nof the “One State” have internalized lessons such as: “we” is from God, and “I”\nis from the devil; that imagination is illness; and that the key to ridding man of\ncrime is ridding him of freedom.\nBut you don’t have to reach to ﬁctional or historical accounts to anticipate\nwhere we are headed. In a 2012 newsletter column, NSA’s “SIGINT Philoso-\npher,” Jacob Weber, shares his own vision. After failing an NSA lie-detector\ntest, he says:\nI found myself wishing that my life would be constantly and completely\nmonitored. It might seem odd that a self-professed libertarian would wish\nan Orwellian dystopia on himself, but here was my rationale: If people knew a\nfew things about me, I might seem suspicious. But if people knew everything\nabout me, they’d see they had nothing to fear.\n. . . A target that119 has no ill will to the U.S., but which is being monitored,\nneeds better and more monitoring, not less. So if we’re in for a penny, we need\nto be in for a pound.120\nShrouded in enormous secrecy and complexity, the basic contours of the\nsurveillance state are fundamentally unknowable. What is the individual to\ndo? With everyone’s communication machine monitored, he knows that he’s a\nde facto target. Millions of observations are made of his life. He is analyzed\nby techniques he cannot remotely understand. He knows that today’s data,\nand yesterday’s, will be scrutinized by tomorrow’s algorithms. These will\nemploy sophisticated natural-language processing, but probably won’t actually\nunderstand human discourse. With all this, the rational individual has no choice\nbut to watch what he says, and to try to act like everyone else.\nThe ﬁlm Citizenfour (2014) is at its best when it manages to sketch the shape\nof this emerging world.

They\nwould have spent years in prison, or even faced execution. Facing such outcomes\nand odds, the activists would not have attempted their daring burglary. In an\nessay that focuses on remedies for excessive surveillance, Richard Stallman asks\nWhere exactly is the maximum tolerable level of surveillance, beyond which\nit becomes oppressive?

If we behave morally,\nit is not because of rational analyses, but an instinctual preference for liberty,\nempathy, or companionship.129 As Schneier points out, animals don’t like to be\nsurveilled because it makes them feel like prey, while it makes the surveillor feel\nlike—and act like—a predator.130 I think people know at an instinctual level\nthat a life in which our thoughts, discourse, and interactions are subjected to\nconstant algorithmic or human monitoring is no life at all.

While mix nets, onion routing, and DC nets have all proven to be\nhighly useful,131 it is not too late to be thinking on new architectures for secure\ncommunications.\nConsider the following problem, which is inspired by Pond and the PANDA\nprotocol that it can use.132 The aim is similar to Adam Langley’s Pond protocol:\nto create an alternative to email or instant messaging but where “big brother”\nis unable to ﬁgure out who is communicating with whom. Unlike Pond, I don’t\nwant to rely on Tor, for we seek security in the face of a global, active adversary\n(as well as a clean, provable-security treatment).

They won’t directly talk with one another; rather,\nall communications will go through an untrusted server. First, parties upgrade\ntheir shared password to a strong key with an anonymous rendezvous protocol.\nThereafter, the sender can deposit a (constant-length) encrypted message at the\nserver. When a party wants to retrieve his ith message, he’ll interact with the\nsame server, which gives him a string computed from the database contents. The\nvalue permits the receiver to recover the intended message—or, alternatively, an\nindication that there is no such ith message for him. But, throughout, all the\nserver ever sees are parties depositing random-looking strings to the server, and\nparties collecting random-looking strings from the server, these computed by\napplying some non-secret function to the server’s non-secret database. Neither\nthe server nor an active, global adversary can ﬁgure out who has communicated\nwith whom, or even whether a communications has taken place. The goal is to\ndo all this as eﬃciently as possible—in particular, much more eﬃciently than\nthe server just handing each recipient its entire database of encrypted messages.\nIn ongoing work, colleagues and I are working out a provable-security\ntreatment for the approach above.

We will see.\nBigkey cryptography Let me next describe some recent work by Mihir Bellare,\nDaniel Kane, and me that we call bigkey cryptography.134\nThe intent of bigkey cryptography is to allow cryptographic operations to\ndepend on enormous keys—megabytes to terabytes long. We want our keys so\nlong that it becomes infeasible for an adversary to exﬁltrate them. Yet using\nsuch a bigkey mustn’t make things slow. This implies that, with each use, only\na small fraction of the bigkey’s bits will be inspected.\nThe basic idea is not new: the concept is usually referred to as security in the\nbounded-retrieval model.135 But our emphasis is new: practical and general tools,\n133 An ambitious but informal attempt to unify terminology and concepts in\nprivacy and anonymity is provided by Andreas Pﬁtzmann and Marit Hansen:\nAnonymity,\nunlinkability,\nundetectability,\nunobservability,\npseudonymity,\nand\nidentity management — a consolidated proposal for terminology.

You want to use it for some protocol P that\nhas been designed to use a conventional-length key K. So choose a random\nvalue R (maybe 256 bits) and hash it to get some number p of probes into the\nbigkey:\ni1 = H(R, 1)\ni2 = H(R, 2)\n. . .\nip = H(R, p) .\nEach probe ij points into K: it’s a number between 1 and |K|. So you grab the p\nbits at those locations and hash them, along with R, to get a derived key K:\nK = H′(R, K[i1], . . . , K[ip]) = XKEY(K, R) .\nWhere you would otherwise have used the protocol P with a shared key K, you\nwill now use P with a shared bigkey K, a freshly chosen R, this determining the\nconventional key K = XKEY(K, R).\nWe show that derived-key K is indistinguishable from a uniformly random\nkey K′ even if the adversary gets R and can learn lots of information about the\nbigkey K. The result is quantitative, measuring how good the derived key is as\na function of the length of the bigkey, the number of bits leaked from it, the\nnumber of probes p, the length of R, and the number of random-oracle calls.\nAt the heart of this result is an information-theoretic question we call the\nsubkey-prediction problem. Imagine a random key K that an adversary can\nexport ℓ< |K| bits of information about. After that leakage, we select p random\nlocations into K, give those locations to the adversary, and ask the adversary\nto predict those p bits. How well can it do?\nIt turns out that the adversary can do better than just recording ℓbits of the\nkey K and hoping that lots of probes fall there. But it can’t do much better. Had\nnothing been leaked to the adversary, ℓ= 0, then each probe would contribute\nabout one bit of entropy to the random variable the adversary must guess. But if,\nsay, half the key is leaked, ℓ≤|K|/2, each probe will now contribute about 0.156\nbits of entropy.136 The adversary’s chance of winning the subkey-prediction game\nwill be bounded by something that’s around 2−0.156p. One needs about p = 820\nprobes for 128-bit security, or twice that for 256-bit security.\nI think that the subkey prediction problem, and the key-encapsulation\nalgorithm based on it, will give rise to nice means for exﬁltration-resistant\nauthenticated-encryption and pseudorandom generators.137 In general, I see\nbounded-storage model: Ueli Maurer: Conditionally-perfect secrecy and a provably-\nsecure randomized cipher.

Here are a few more examples of crypto-for-privacy work.\nConsider the beautiful paper on Riposte, by Corrigan-Gibbs, Boneh, and\nMazi`eres.138 A user, speaking with others on the Internet, wants to broadcast a\nmessage, such as a leaked document, without revealing his identity. The network\nis subject to pervasive monitoring. The authors develop deﬁnitions, protocols,\nand proofs for the problem, attending closely to eﬃciency.139 They implement\ntheir schemes. Combining all these elements is rare—and very much needed.140\nOr consider the work of Colin Percival in which he introduced the hash\nfunction scrypt.141 Percival explained that, when applying an intentionally\nslow-to-compute hash function to a password and salt so as to up the cost of\ndictionary attacks,142 it is better if the hash function can’t be sped up all that\nmuch with custom hardware. To achieve this aim, computing the hash function\nshouldn’t just take lots of time, but lots of (sequentially accessed) memory. This\ninsightful idea comes from Abadi, Burrow, Manasse, and Wobber, who wanted\nto make sure that, for a variety of settings, computing an intentionally-slow\nhash function on a high-end system would take roughly as long as computing\nit on a low-end system.143 Quite recently, a Password Hashing Competition\nDavid Pointcheval, Sylvain Ruhault, Damien Vergnaud, Daniel Wichs: Security\nanalysis of pseudo-random number generators with input: /dev/random is not\nrobust.

As I hope the examples I have given illustrate, there are important\ncrypto-for-privacy problems out there, and they are quite diverse. Choose your\nproblems well. Let values inform your choice. Many times I have spoken to people\nwho seem to have no real idea why they are studying what they are. The real\nanswer is often that they can do it, it gets published, and that people did this\nstuﬀbefore. These are lousy reasons for doing something.\nIntrospection can’t be rushed.

Do anti-surveillance research.\n▷Be introspective about why you are working on the problems you are.\nIn enumerating example directions for anti-surveillance research, I didn’t\ninclude the kind of work, rather common in the PET (privacy-enhancing\ntechnology) literature, that assumes that there will be pervasive collection, and\nthen tries to do what one can to minimize misuse.154 Since the immorality occurs\nat the point of data collection, the aim here is to try to blunt the impact of the\nwrong already done. But it is hard to know how this plays out. I am concerned\nthat the work can play into the hands of those who seek technical support\nfor a position that says, in eﬀect, “the collect-it-all approach is inevitable and\nonly temporarily problematic, for, once we ﬁgure this all out, privacy will be\nhandled downstream, when the data is used.” But pervasive collection itself\nchills free-speech and threatens liberal democracy, regardless of what one claims\nwill happen downstream.155\nPractice-oriented provable security.

These aims may not be one’s own. For example,\nthe mission of DARPA is “to invest in the breakthrough technologies that can\ncreate the next generation of [U.S.] national security capabilities.” Having begun\nin the wake of Sputnik, the agency speaks of avoiding technological surprise—and\ncreating it for America’s enemies.165 In the USA, the NSA advises other DoD\nagencies on crypto-related grants. At least sometimes, they advise the NSF. Back\nin 1996, the NSA tried to quash my own NSF CAREER award. I learned this\nfrom my former NSF program manager, Dana Latch, who not only refused the\nNSA request, but, annoyed by it, told me. An internal history of the NSA reports\non the mistake of theirs that allowed funding the grant leading to RSA.\nNSA had reviewed the Rivest [grant] application, but the wording was so\ngeneral that the Agency did not spot the threat and passed it back to NSF\nwithout comment.

Cryptographers have internalized\nthis. Mostly, we’ve been in the business of helping business and government\nkeep things safe. Governments and companies have become our “customers,” not\nsome ragtag group of activists, journalists, or dissidents, and not some abstract\nnotion of the people.

Unexercised, academic freedom will wither and die.\nMany nonacademics also have something akin to academic freedom: suﬃcient\nautonomy to work on what they think is important, without losing their jobs,\neven if it’s not what their employer really wants or likes.\n▷Use the academic freedom that you have.\n168 People will of course point to Tor as a counterexample; it has received funding from\nDARPA, ONR, and the State Department.

I think that many cryptographers would do well to foster a\nmore open-minded attitude to unfamiliar models, approaches, and goals. The dis-\nciplinary narrowing within cryptography’s tier-1 venues has been pronounced.173\nMany people seem to hold rather strident beliefs about what kinds of work are\ngood. Sometimes it borders on silliness, as when people refuse to use the word\nproof for proofs in the random-oracle model. (Obviously a proof in the random-\noracle model is no less a proof than a proof in any other model.)\nAs cryptographers, we must always be sensitive, and skeptical, about the\nrelationship between our models and actual privacy or security. This doesn’t\nmean that we should not take models seriously. It means that should see them as\ntentative and dialectical. There’s a lovely aphorism from statistician George Box,\nwho said that all models are wrong, but some are useful.174\nCryptography needs useful models. But the assessment of a model’s utility\nis itself problematic. We ask of deﬁnitions: How clean? How understandable?\nHow general? What aspects of the computing environment are covered? What\ndoes and doesn’t it imply? The deﬁnitional enterprise sits at a juncture of math,\naesthetics, philosophy, technology, and culture. So situated, dogma is disease.\nIt has been claimed that the mission of theoretical cryptography is to deﬁne\nand construct provably secure cryptographic protocols and schemes.175 But this\nis an activity of theoretical cryptography, not its mission. There are many other\nactivities. One might work on models and results that are completely rigorous but\nfall outside of the provable-security framework.176 Or one can take an important\nprotocol as ﬁxed and then analyze it, in whatever framework works best. The\naim for my own work has been to develop ideas that I hope will contribute\nto the construction of secure computing systems. In the symbology of Amit\nSahai’s lovely ﬂower-garden,177 theory-minded cryptographers can be gardeners,\ngrowing seeds (hardness assumptions) into ﬂowers (cryptographic goals); but\n173 For the most part, hardware is gone, formalistic approaches to cryptography are gone\n(unless they claim to bridge to “real” crypto), cryptanalysis of real-world schemes\nis little to be seen, and so on.\n174 George E.

N., Robustness in Statistics, Academic Press, pp. 201–236, 1979.\nBox was not the ﬁrst to express this sentiment. For example, Georg Rasch explained,\nin 1960, that “When you construct a model you leave out all the details which you,\nwith the knowledge at your disposal, consider inessential. . . . Models should not be\ntrue, but it is important that they are applicable, and whether they are applicable\nfor any given purpose must of course be investigated.

I would encourage cryptographers—especially young\npeople in our ﬁeld—to try to get a systems-level view of what is going on when\ncryptography is used. You need a way better view of things than a technophobe\nlike me will ever have.\nI remember reading that 2012 paper of Dan Boneh and his coauthors, The\nMost Dangerous Code in the World,178 and feeling humbled by the fact that\nthere was this entire universe of code—this middleware—that I didn’t even know\nexisted, but that could, and routinely did, annul the cryptography that was\nthere. When the NSA revelations caused people to speculate as to how Internet\ncryptography was being defeated, it occurred to me that perhaps the NSA didn’t\nneed any clever cryptanalysis—what they needed, most of all, was to buy exploits\nand hire people with a systems-level view of the computing ecosystem.\nOne approach that might be useful for gaining a good vantage is to take an\nAPI-centric view of things.179 Not only are API misunderstandings a common\nsecurity problem, but gaps between cryptographic formalizations and APIs can\nproduce serious cryptographic problems.180 And in the constructive direction,\nthe notion of online-AE, for example,181 eﬀectively ﬂows from taking an API-\ncentric view.

I would like to gently suggest that we cryptogra-\nphers would do well to learn, and use, contemporary privacy tools. Very few of us\nuse tools like OTR, PGP, Signal, Tails, and Tor. It’s kind of an embarrassment—\nand I suspect our collective work suﬀers for it.

What problems do you not want a\nbunch of super-smart academics to solve?\n▷Stop with the cutesy pictures. Take adversaries seriously.\nA cryptographic commons. Many people see the Internet as some sort of\nmagniﬁcent commons. This is a fantasy. There are some successful commons\nwithin the Internet: Wikipedia, the free software movement, Creative Commons,\nOpenSSL, Tor, and more. But most people turn almost exclusively to services\nmediated by a handful of corporations that provide the electronic mail, instant\nmessaging, cloud storage, and cloud computing, for example, that people use.\nAnd they provide the hardware on which all this stuﬀsits.\nWe need to erect a much expanded commons on the Internet. We need to\nrealize popular services in a secure, distributed, and decentralized way, powered\nby free software and free/open hardware. We need to build systems beyond the\nreach of super-sized companies and spy agencies. Such services must be based\non strong cryptography. Emphasizing that prerequisite, we need to expand our\ncryptographic commons.\nDreams for such a commons go back to the cypherpunks, who built remailers,\nfor example, as a communitarian service to enable secure communications. More\nrecently, Feigenbaum and Koenig articulate such a vision.187 After explaining\nthat centralized cloud services play a central role in enabling mass surveillance,\nthey call for a grass-roots eﬀort to develop new, global-scale cloud services based\non open-source, decentralized, conﬁguration-management tools.\n184 Despite all these comments, I think a graphic novel on cryptography could be great.\nSomething like the work of Keith Aoki, James Boyle: Bound By Law: Tales from the\nPublic Domain, 2006.\n185 Exploits that nobody else knows about.\n186 The phrases are from an NSA slide released by Snowden.

It could become a routine undertaking at IACR conferences and\nworkshops, or at Dagstuhl meeting, for folks to gather around for an afternoon\nor evening to write, revise, and verify selected Wikipedia pages dealing with\ncryptography. It’s the sort of eﬀort that will pay oﬀin many unseen ways.\n▷Design and build a broadly useful cryptographic commons.\nCommunications. In advancing our ﬁeld, well-named notions have always been\nimportant. One has only to think back to zero-knowledge (and the competing\nterm minimal-disclosure) to recall how a beautiful phrase could help catapult\na beautiful idea into prominence. Similarly, the six-letter phrase 33 bits does\na remarkably good job of embodying an important concept without going\nanywhere near contested vocabulary.188 In both cryptography and privacy,\nlanguage is both formative and fraught.\nThe word privacy, its meaning abstract and debated, its connotations often\nnegative, is not a winning word. Privacy is for medical records, toileting, and\nsex — not for democracy or freedom. The word anonymity is even worse: modern\npolitical parlance has painted this as nearly a ﬂavor of terrorism. Security is\nmore winning a word and, in fact, I spoke of secure messaging instead of private\nmessaging or anonymous messaging because I think it better captures what I\nwant conveyed: that a communication whose endpoints are manifest is not at all\nsecure. A person needs to feel insecure if using such a channel.\nBut even the word security doesn’t support a good framing of our problem:\nwe should try to speak of thwarting mass surveillance more than enhancing\nprivacy, anonymity, or security. As discussed before, we know instinctively\nthat ubiquitous surveillance is incompatible with freedom, democracy, and\nhuman rights.189 This makes surveillance a thing against which one can ﬁght.\nThe surveillance camera and data center make visual our emerging dystopia,\nwhile privacy, anonymity, and security are so abstract as to nearly defy visual\nrepresentation.\nConcretely, research that aims to undermine objectionable surveillance\nmight be called anti-surveillance research.190 Tools for this end would be anti-\nsurveillance technologies.191 And choosing the problems one works on based on\nan ethical vision might be called conscience-based research.\n▷Choose language well. Communication is integral to having an impact.\n188 The value refers, of course, to the number of bit needed to identify a living human.\nSee Arvind Narayanan’s website 33bits.org\n189 For a beautiful exposition of this idea, see Eben Moglen: Privacy under attack: the\nNSA ﬁles revealed new threats to democracy.

But I am actually more concerned\nabout how we, as cryptographers and computer scientists, act in aggregate. Our\ncollective behavior embodies values—and the institutions we create do, too.\nI do not intend to criticize any particular individual. People should and will\nwork on what they think to be most valuable. The problem occurs when our\ncommunity, as a whole, systematically devalues utility or social worth. Then we\nhave a collective failure. The failure falls on no one in particular, and yet it falls\non everyone.\nConclusion to it all. Many before me have discussed the importance of ethics,\ndisciplinary culture, and political context in shaping what we do. For example,\nNeal Koblitz asserts that the founding of the CRYPTO conference in 1981 was\nitself an act of deﬁance. He warns of the corrupting role that funding can play.\nAnd he concludes his own essay with an assertion that drama and conﬂict are\ninherent in cryptography, but that this also makes for some of the ﬁeld’s fun.192\nSusan Landau reminds us that privacy reaches far beyond engineering, and into\nlaw, economics, and beyond. She reminds us that minimizing data collection is\npart of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.193\nAs computer scientists and cryptographers, we are twice culpable when it\ncomes to mass surveillance: computer science created the technologies that\nunderlie our communications infrastructure, and that are now turning it into\nan apparatus for surveillance and control; while cryptography contains within it\nthe underused potential to help redirect this tragic turn.194\nAuthors and ﬁlmmakers, futurists and scientists, have laid out many\ncompeting visions for man’s demise. For example, Bill Joy worries about\nnanotechnology turning the biosphere into gray goo, or super-intelligent robots\ndeciding that man is a nuisance, or a pet.195 I don’t lose sleep over such\npossibilities; I don’t see them as our likely end. But a creeping surveillance that\ngrows organically in the public and private sectors, that becomes increasingly\ncomprehensive, entwined, and predictive, that becomes an instrument for\nassassination, political control, and the maintenance of power—well, this vision\ndoesn’t merely seem possible, it seems to be happening before our eyes.\nI am not optimistic. The ﬁgure of the heroic cryptographer sweeping in to\nsave the world from totalitarian surveillance is ludicrous.196 And in a world where\n192 Neal Koblitz: The uneasy relationship between mathematics and cryptography.\nNotices of the AMS, 54(8), pp. 972–979, September 2007.\n193 Susan Landau: Privacy and security: a multidimensional problem.

And\nperhaps a dose of that cypherpunk verve.208\nIt has been said that just because you don’t take an interest in politics,\ndoesn’t mean politics won’t take an interest in you.209 Since cryptography is a\ntool for shifting power, the people who know this subject well, like it or not,\ninherit some of that power. As a cryptographer, you can ignore this landscape of\npower, and all political and moral dimensions of our ﬁeld. But that won’t make\nthem go away. It will just tend to make your work less relevant or socially useful.\nMy hope for this essay is that you will internalize this fact and recognize it\nas the starting point for developing an ethically driven vision for what you want\nto accomplish with your scientiﬁc work.\nI began this essay speaking of the Russell–Einstein manifesto, so let me end\nthere as well, with Joseph Rotblat’s plea from his Nobel prize acceptance speech:\nAt a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society, when\nthe destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientiﬁc\nresearch, it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role, and\nconduct themselves accordingly. I appeal to my fellow scientists to remember\ntheir responsibility to humanity.210\nAcknowledgments\nMy thanks go ﬁrst to Mihir Bellare for countless discussions on the topic of this\nessay. For years, not only have we collaborated closely on technical matters, but\nwe have also much discussed the values and sensibilities implicitly embedded\nwithin cryptographic work. Without Mihir, not only would I have done far less\ntechnically, but I would also understand far less about who cryptographers are.\nRon Rivest not only provided useful comments, but has been much on my\nmind as I have agonized over this essay. Many other people have given me\nimportant suggestions and ideas.

Rogaway\nMy view of what science is and what the scientist should be was strongly\nshaped by watching Jacob Bronowski when I was a child.211\nAll original technical work mentioned in this essay (e.g., what is described\nin the ﬁrst pages of Part 4) was supported by NSF Grant CNS 1228828. But I\nemphasize that all opinions, ﬁndings, conclusions and recommendations in this\nessay (and this essay is mostly opinions and recommendations) reﬂect the views\nof the author alone, not necessarily the views of the National Science Foundation.\nThanks to the Schloss Dagstuhl staﬀand to the participants of workshop\n14401, Privacy and Security in an Age of Surveillance, where ideas related to\nthis essay were discussed.212\nSome of the work on this essay was done while I was a guest professor at\nENS, Paris, hosted by David Pointcheval.\nMy thanks to the IACR Board for the privilege of giving this year’s\nIACR Distinguished Lecture.
